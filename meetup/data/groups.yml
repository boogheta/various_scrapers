    The Quantified Self Malta meetup is inspired by the Bay Area Quantified Self Show & Tell meetings started in 2008 by Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly in the Bay Area. Your host for the Malta meetup is Phil Rocquemore (@cardquant). Write me with your recommendations, tips, and observations.
    This is a regular show and tell for people who take advantage of various personal self-tracking tools and methods to gain more knowledge about themselves, others and the world around them. Come share what you are doing and learn from others. Anything is game -- from personal genetics to ways to digitize and track information, from how to self-diagnose to how to self-experiment with data and statistics. More specific topics include:
    * self-experimentation * using data and statistics to further self-experimentation * behavior monitoring, tracking, and modification (including studying habit forming and breaking) * lifelogging, lifecaching, and lifestreaming * location tracking * generating, capturing, and working with biometric data * psychological self-assessments * medical self-diagnostics and keeping track of one's own medical data * personal genetics and genome sequencing

  description: This is the local Phoenix chapter of Quantified Self; an organization
    dedicated to helping individuals learn more about themselves through self-tracking.
    Anyone interested in trying to better understand themselves through self-tracking
    (e.g., through using tools like the Fitbit or Jawbone UP or other tools) should
    join. This particular chapter is interested in self-tracking as a tool for behavior
    change and in the use of the scientific method for improving one's life. If you
    are more interested in life extension, human enhancement devices, augmentations,
    etc. you should consider joining our sister group, Quantified Self Scottsdale.
    The QS Phoenix/ASU group is led by a professor at ASU in the School of Nutrition
    and Health Promotion. While there is a strong contingent of people from ASU, all
    are welcome to join. If you have any questions, please email Eric Hekler at ehekler@asu.edu.

    Der LifeModding Gedanke versteht die eigene Person sowie die räumliche und soziale Umwelt als beeinflussbare Entwicklungsfelder.

    Lifemodding beschäftigt sich mit der zielgerichteten positiven Beeinflussung des persönlichen Lebensumfeldes. Im Fokus stehen dabei im engeren Sinne physische, psychische, kognitive sowie soziale Entwicklungsfelder. Berücksichtigung findet auch das direkte Lebensumfeld repräsentiert durch Wohnräume/Einrichtung sowie den allgemeinen Lifestyle.

    Nutzen und Mehrwert durch den LifeModding-Gedanken manifestiert sich in gesteigertem Wohlbefinden, einer ausgeprägteren (Selbst)-wahrnehmung sowie gesteigerter Produktivität in Alltag, Studium bzw. Beruf.

    Im Kerngedanke steht die genaue Betrachtung von Verhaltensweisen, Gewohnheiten Persönlichkeitsmerkmale aber auch die Funktionalität/Zweckdienlichkeit von (Alltags-) Gegenständen.

    Quantified Self St. Louis

    What's Happening: The Quantified Self (QS) community is getting organized in St. Louis, with our first event on Tuesday, January 21st! This global movement is all about tracking data about ourselves, using tools to make sense of it, and acting on it to improve our physical, mental, and emotional health and performance.
    QS brings together people across a broad spectrum - from those tracking health, fitness, and diet, to others playing with the tech, research and data that are enabling progress.

    We hope that whether you are a hard-core athlete, patient with a rare or chronic disease, health/tech entrepreneur, data nerd, or are just curious about the space that you will find a vibrant community of self-trackers from in and around St. Louis.
    What To Expect:  We welcome you to attend our Meetups and participate in lively discussions and activities, including:
    • Show and tell sessions to check out each others' trackers, apps, monitors, sensors and other tools.

    • "Hands-on" Hackathons to play with, improve or even create our own tools.

    • Roundtable and/or "popcorn" discussions to discuss self-tracking on an individual and a St. Louis basis.

    Regardless, you'll probably find something of interest as we launch our group. Join the meetup to get notices about our meetings and other activities or contact us to learn more or share your story.

    Tracking Topics Include: • Fitness, diet, and health • Medical self-diagnostics • Metabolic factors • Lifelogging • Personal genome sequencing • Sleep • Location  • Mood and emotion • Chemical body load counts • Productivity/Behavior • and Self experimentation

  description: |-
    Consciousness Hacking is a hands-on approach to making new tools for self-exploration, in order to change the way we think, feel, and live. Its an inside out perspective on how technology can serve us by changing our relationship to the world, rather than the world itself. (note: This is NOT about unauthorized or forced influence over anyone or anything.) Meetings will focus more on sharing existing projects, and receiving community support for new ideas, and less on philosophy or theory.
    Have an idea for a cool EEG + meditation app?  Maybe you're interested in a new way of creating sound to alter the way the brain works?  This is the place to explore or present your idea.  In the spirit of the Maker Movement or Quantified Self but with the pragmatic spiritual influence of Buddhist Geeks or Dharma Overground, the ultimate purpose of the group is to empower YOU to develop new tools for changing the way you feel and live. You do not need a technology background, and you are absolutely welcome to join if you have no interest in ever developing your own tools, but there will definitely be a heavy focus on modern technology as the hacking medium.
    Science is increasingly recognizing what spiritual and religious traditions have been advocating for thousands of years: through focused self-awareness we can fundamentally change our conscious experience. The keys to accessing profound joy and contentment in this world lie not in our external circumstances, but in our relationship to ourselves. Its impossible to deny the profound benefits reaped by long time meditation practitioners, living in solitude or intentional communities. Is there a modern enlightenment, in harmony with the media and technology that seems to constantly externalize our attention, and increase our sense of separation from ourselves and others? Can we create new forms of technology that bring us back to ourselves? Can we leverage existing technologies to help us cultivate calm minds, lower stress, and rediscover our sense of connectedness and the simple joy of being alive here and now?
    Consumer EEG headsets are beginning to flood the market enabling inexpensive access to brain activity. Bio sensing technology capable of measuring signals such as pulse, skin conductivity, or physical movement are readily available as commercial products. Computation is no longer a limiting factor, and massive amounts of data can be scoured for patterns no human mind could identify. New methods of neural-stimulation, such as tDCS, TMS and pulsed ultrasound, are being explored and are available to the pioneering hacker. Neuroscience research is beginning to deeply explore the nature of not only meditation, but of mystical and enlightened states. And these examples are just the tip of the iceberg.

    측정하고 기록하는지부터 시작하여 어떻게 통찰력을 갖게 되는지, 우리의 삶의 질을 향상시키는데 어떻게 데이터를 활용하는지 등 모든 것에 대해
    논하고 공유했으면 합니다. 오늘 저희 그룹에 가입하셔서 다른 분들과 quantified self에 대해 공유하시기 바랍니다. 감사합니다.

    Consciousness Hacking is a pragmatic approach to creating tools and techniques for exploring and altering our conscious experience. This meetup will range from discussion, project/experience sharing, and hands-on exploration. Think Quantified-Self meets Maker Movement meets meditation.
    The brain, mind, and ultimately our underlying sense of purpose and wellbeing are the ultimate hacking frontier. But our efforts are more often than not focused on changing our external world to suit some need or desire. What if we flipped that, and focused on transforming our own subjective experience? Its not a new idea - humans have been hacking consciousness for millennia with tools like meditation, breathing, dance, music, ceremony… the list is long. All of these are forms of 'technology' evolved over thousands of years by 'scientists' relentlessly studying the fundamental nature of direct experience. Why? Because human suffering can be eradicated, from the inside out. Its this crowd, not a yogi in a cave, that has the skills and motivation to create modern tools that fundamentally transform our reality. Let us join together in exploring the wild and wide open world of consciousness hacking.

  description: |-
    This is a group for anyone interested in wearable technology, biohacking/biosensors, and meeting others who are passionate about learning and building within this space. This is for big thinkers and driven creators, so technical and non-technical types are equally welcome.  I started this group for other innovators, hackers, and entrepreneurs who are interested in pushing current technologies to better track and optimize ourselves and the changing world around us.
    The vision for this Meetup is to create a collaborative physical space with a strong emphasis on developing products and teams for personal projects, hackathons/competitions, startups, etc that focus on wearable technology. Seattle is rich with thought leaders, creators, and crazy people who want to disrupt or improve existing paradigms. I truly look forward to meeting you people.
    The initial motivation for this Meetup came from my growing interest in sleep optimization and “smart alarms." Smart alarm applications use features like a cell phone's accelerometer to estimate one's REM cycle stage in order to turn on during the lightest stage of sleep. The goal is to optimize a standard alarm, to eliminate the typical unrested morning feeling, and to minimize unproductiveness from interruption during deeper sleep cycles.

    “The past ten years have been about discovering new ways to create, invent, and work together on the Web. The next ten years will be about applying those lessons to the real world.” — Chris Anderson (courtesy of the Hack Things meetup page)

    The Cincinnati Quantified Self Meetup Group is patterned after the Bay Area Quantified Self Meetup and inspired by the commentary shared on the Quantified Self blog and other related sources.
    Our Meetup is for people who are actively engaged in (or interested in learning more about) self-tracking and understanding how data associated with our minds, bodies and behaviors can be harnessed for self-improvement.
    Our group is for fit-actives, techies, creative’s, etc... alike (i.e. you don't need to be a running/cycling/fitness/health junkie to be welcomed)!
    Our Meetups will follow the "Show and Tell" format outlined on the Quantified Self Org. site. Anything is game topic wise...but generally, our focus and discussion will be in areas such as:

    self-experimentation;
    digital tools & systems for personal data monitoring (wearable/portable technologies, etc...);
    behavior monitoring, tracking, and modification;
    lifelogging, lifecaching, and lifestreaming;
    location tracking/GPS/geocaching;
    generating, capturing, and working with biometric and behavioral data;
    psychological self-assessments & motivational factors;

    Welcome to Effective Altruism Melbourne!
    We are the local chapter of an international community of people trying to do as much good as possible.

    Effective altruists combine the head and the heart. The heart motivates us to be empathetic and and altruistic towards others, while the head makes sure that what we do is effective and well-directed.

    We ask questions such as: Which causes will have the greatest impact on the world? Where should we devote our time and money? Whichcareers do the most good?

    In Melbourne, we host regular informal lunches, talks by international effective altruists, and group excursions to interesting events.

    To learn more about “effective altruism”, check out:

    Quantified Self Women's meetup - Boston chapter.
    Inspired by the QSXX SF meetup group. (http://www.meetup.com/QSXX-Quantified-Self-Womens-Meetup/)
    Do you track your weight or your period in a journal or calendar? Do you use a Nike Plus or a Fitbit? Do you use a financial management tool like Mint.com? Then you might be a quantified self.
    We're all generating lots of data, whether actively recording it or using transactions, apps, and sensors to generate the data. What do we do with that data? What can it tell us about ourselves?
    People in the Quantified Self community have been self-tracking and analyzing their data in novel ways. We are doing experiments, running correlations, fostering new habits. More tools are entering the consumer market to make it easier for us to track ourselves without much effort and we're starting to find tools that help us make sense of our disparate data sets. It's not just geeks or science bros running statistical correlations in R. Creating data can be just as useful as a tool for building awareness about a goal you have.
    Women's voices in the QS community are underrepresented, even though we've all been tracking things forever. We're hoping to change that. What does your data tell you about yourself? What can women learn when they take advantage of the existing data, and use more tools to generate novel data about our bodies, minds, and our environment?

    We want to create a space for all the interesting, women specific QS conversations we want to have. For women and people who identify or have identified significantly as non-male. Let's get together to talk about what we're tracking, what we're learning, and how we want to share it.
    The Quantified Self movement involves exploring the self through numbers. Some potential topics of interest might include:
    - Behavior monitoring

    - LIfelogging

    - Fitness and health tracking

    - Chemical body load counts

    - Personal genome sequencing

    - Metabolic monitoring

    - Self experimentation

    - Location tracking

    - Sleep tracking

    - Mood and emotion tracking

    - Medical self-diagnostics

    - Digital body info

    - Psychological self-assessments

    Quantified Self is a movement to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person's daily life in terms nutrition, sports, sleep and mood et cetera. Such self-monitoring is usually done with wearable sensors and smart phone apps.
    Biohacking is to use systems thinking, science, biology, and self-experimentation to take control of and upgrade your body, your mind, and your life. It is the art and science of becoming superhuman.
    Put together it is all about self-knowledge and upgrading yourself with the help of technological and biological tools.
    Quantified Self & Biohacking Finland brings like-minded individuals and companies from the field together and organizes event in Finland.

    both their data and programs in a way that directly benefits them, In this context
    - Dropbox, Evernote or many other applications which support individuals - but

    to control multiple programmable persistent computational objects that exist in
    a securable globally unique identity space. None of this implies technology that

    Quantified Self Warsaw meetup is modeled on the San Francisco Bay Area Quantified Self Show&Tell meetings started in 2008 by Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly of Wired magazine. It’s a casual meeting for users and makers of self-tracking tools.
    Quantified Self is about measuring yourself with sensors, apps and other technology to collect data and make that data useful through visualisation and other ways of feedback.
    This group is one of many QS groups around the world and is associated with the Quantified Self blog.
    You can also find us on Facebook.
    Topics include, but are not limited to:
    Self-tracking, self-quantifying, self-monitoring
    Life-logging, lifecaching, lifestreaming
    Location tracking
    Fitness and health tracking
    Sleep tracking
    Behavior monitoring
    Self-experimentation
    Medical self-diagnostics
    Biohacking
    Chemical body load counts
    Personal genome sequencing
    Metabolic monitoring
    Psychological self-assessments
    Mood and emotion tracking
    Visualizations of personal information
    Come share what you are doing, and learn from others!
    What does a typical presentation involve?
    Give a first person account of an actual self-tracking project. A typical presentation is 5-10 minutes long. Informal. Personal. Based on real world experience. At the Quantified Self, we talk about our first hand experiences using self-tracking methods and tools. This approach is embodied in Three Prime Questions:
    1. What did you do?
    2. How did you do it?
    3. What did you learn?
    We like scientific theories, demos of tools and apps, and philosophical speculation. But in the context of a Quantified Self Show&Tell they distract unless they are grounded in actual attempts at self-tracking and self-experiment. When theory or demonstrations are embedded in an account of personal experience, however, they work great. Tell us what you’ve done, how you did it, and what it means to you, before making the leap to speculative assertions or entrepreneurial self-praise. Your listeners will learn more, and everybody will have a better time.
    The first Polish QS meetup was formed in Krakow. While Krakow and Warsaw groups will organize their separate meetups, we’d like QS Poland to be the first go-to place for QS organizers from any other Polish cities. If you want to create a QS meetup in your hometown, feel free to contact us (in English or in Polish) at quantifiedselfpoland@gmail.com

    Electrophysiology modalities:
    electroencephalography (EEG) = brain
    surface electromyography (sEMG) = muscles
    electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) = heart
    The idea is to create a community focused on active EXG experimentation. Meet regularly, design, execute, and analyze results from experiments, together. The purpose of this group is to create a small community of people interested in electrophysiology sensor-based self-experimentation. We have some research-grade sensors and equipment which we can use together. Please bring your sensors / systems as well. I have easy signal processing tools (Matlab) ready to use so that we can do analysis together as well, making it a complete process. Other methods and tools welcome. :) The idea is to informally ask questions and actively gather data, work on experiments, and complete analyses together.
    I'm starting this because I have been self-experimenting with biohacking and lifehacking techniques using electrophysiology sensors (sEMG, EKG, EEG), and realized there is no in-person community built around actual data-gathering and experimentation with these kinds of sensors (i.e. "lets get together every week and measure our EEG, EKG, or sEMG data in some context that is interesting or relevant to us.)
    How is this different than Quantified Self? At QS, people come together and share their experiences with self-tracking. Here, we don't talk about completed activity as much as help each other rapidly design, execute, and analyze the results of quick experiments (which can then later be shared with others, of course), and typically our experimental "n size" is greater than 1. So we are all about active groups designing and carrying out experiments together, vs individuals working with self-tracking.
    Some ideas...
    -> The other day Lily started talking to me about how Kundalini Yoga made her feel more mentally focused, and I suggested we test it by recording her EEG before and after an intensive day-long White Tantra meditation marathon.
    -> A few months earlier, Nick and I experimented a bit with bench press to max while measuring sEMG to see what the muscle data looks like as the muscles get stronger over a few months.
    -> Awhile back, I started comparing sEMG in the forearms and wrists while typing at different kinds of computer keyboards - can we quantify "ergonomic"? Can we determine which products are generally safer / require least muscle force to operate?
    -> How do different breathing patterns (Pranayama) affect Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Stress?
    -> How does caffeine affect my ability to focus/concentrate, as measured through EEG? In-house sensor modalities include: sEMG, EKG / ECG, EEG (adhesive-based, 2ch max, not full-cap), Skin Conductance, Respiration (pressure strap), PPG, Pulse Oximeter, and of course... the accelerometers and gyros we all carry around with us (iPhones...)
    Let's start experimenting!

    on aspects of a person''s daily life in terms of inputs, states, and performance.
    The belief is that gathering and analyzing this data can help improve a person''s
    life. The notion of marrying technology and self-improvement started in San Francisco,
    where Gary Wolf, a journalist and author, co-founded the “Quantified Self” blog
    in 2007. This led to regular meetings, which are now held in over 50 cities around
    the world. What is this QS meetup about? The QS Shanghai meetup is a casual monthly
    gathering for users and makers of self tracking tools. Topics include, but are
    not limited to: Fitness and health tracking Lifelogging Metabolic monitoring Self
    experimentation Behavior monitoring Location tracking Sleep tracking Mood and

    This group will act as a think tank on the practical issues in the development of the strategy, formation, and mission of an EcoCitizens “presentfuture” model of addressing the exponential increase and fair proliferation of technology.
    Please read the following Preliminary Mission Statement:
    EcoCitizens’ mission is to guide the global citizenry through the exponential advancement of technology across multiple sectors as it is employed to save, enhance, and re-define human life and the environment.
    EcoCitizens will seek to develop broad-based, innovative, strategic partnerships to monitor intelligent technology, inform the global citizenry on rapid technology adoption, advocate for accelerated education and human intelligence to adapt to technology proliferation, and apply variable thought to the perpetual development and advancement of technology.
    In brief, the four pillars of the organizational mission are currently: 1) Monitor; 2) Inform; 3) Educate; 4) Guide.
    Meetups will focus on one or more of the four pillars. Organizational structure and Administration will also be open for discussion.
    The four pillars can be understood as follows:
    Monitor refers to the ability to develop innovative partnerships with advanced technology corporations and institutions which would protect IP and which would create a broad network to facilitate accelerated technology with a global citizenry voice at the powermaker table.
    Inform refers to an information delivery system or systems which build on top of or in concert with current news delivery, social network services, or other grassroots networks. This would include thinking through ways and means of reaching those who are at least advantage.
    Educate refers to the educational delivery and uptake systems both external and internal to the biological and biotech (future) human systems. It would work to advocate vertical and horizontal “up-education” to ensure fairness.
    Guide refers to the more delicate nature of wisdom recognition and wisdom building as we currently understand it, how to cultivate that through a cross-cultural network, and how to guide wisdom-building as technology will enhance biological wisdom processes.

    * self-experimentation
    * using data and statistics to further self-experimentation
    * behavior monitoring, tracking, and modification (including studying habit forming and breaking)
    * lifelogging, lifecaching, and lifestreaming
    * location tracking
    * generating, capturing, and working with biometric data
    * psychological self-assessments
    * medical self-diagnostics and keeping track of one's own medical data
    * personal genetics and genome sequencing

    ###
    I am in the process of coordinating this and am going to kick off the first meeting ASAP. If you guys have any suggestions for speakers, topics you would like the group to focus on, or anything else, send me a message.
    ###

    This is a group for folks interested in quantified self technology and research.

    Self tracking is a technology promising to disrupt how we think about health but it's still in it's infancy. It's potential is just beginning to be realized as research publications roll out and proof-of-concept tools are built.

    If you are asking yourself "Damn, why aren't we building these things already?" This groups for you.

    Our meets will focus on tech talks to show what tools/products/research people have made/done and socials to encourage collaboration on ideas, products, and projects.

    We are doers and builders, startups and researchers, makers and hackers, if you are too come and join us. Cheers!

    Self Knowledge through data.
    Quantified Self is a regular show and tell for people who are tracking data about their body and conducting their own personal investigations and research into their bodies, minds, and selves.
    Anything is game -- from personal genetics to ways to digitize and track information, from how to self-diagnose to how to self-experiment with data and statistics. More specific topics include:
    * self-experimentation

    * using data and statistics to further self-experimentation

    * behavior monitoring, tracking, and modification (including studying habit forming and breaking)

    * lifelogging, lifecaching, and lifestreaming

    * location tracking

    * generating, capturing, and working with biometric data

    * psychological self-assessments

    * medical self-diagnostics and keeping track of one's own medical data

    * personal genetics and genome sequencing

    Developers create solutions to problems in complex systems. "Health" involves an unbelievably complex system (the body), tangled up with an unfathomably real abstraction (the mind) and wrapped in a morass of business, government, and good intentions so labyrinthine in nature that it would make Kafka cry. If you love exploring elegant fixes to problems of mind-shattering difficulty in a collaborative environment then Health Devs is the group for you.

    Things health devs do:
    * Show off hacks we've built that transform health and healthcare
    * Share information on the nuts and bolts of developing healthcare technologies -- everything from hacking healthcare's many non-standard "standards" to building great UI for doctors to integrating with EHRs
    * Talk about the core problems of plaguing healthcare, and how to hack them

    Quantified Self is a collaboration of users and tool makers who share an interest in self knowledge through self-tracking. We exchange information about our personal projects, the tools we use, tips we've gleaned, lessons we've learned. We blog, meet face to face, and collaborate online. You are welcome to join us!
    From how to self-diagnose to how to self-experiment with data and statistics, Quantified Selfers might be those curiously engaging in a host of intelligence-gathering in the form of:
    - life logging,
    - sleep tracking,
    - personal genomics, personal genetics and genome sequencing
    - medical self-diagnostics and keeping track of one's own medical data
    - location tracking,
    - biometrics,
    - psychological self-assessments,
    - caffeine experiments,
    - behaviour tracking,
    - productivity tweakery

    The DFW Quantified Self Meetup is inspired by the Bay Area Quantified Self Meetup and the Quantified Self blog.
    The group hosts two types of meetings:

    "QS Show and Tell" meetings are structured meetings designed for people to share their experiences in thinking about, collecting analyzing and using data related to themselves and their environments.
    "QS Chat" meetings are loosely structured discussions usually with a smaller group. Some sessions have a specific topic or theme while others may operate with a 'bring your own topic' format.

    Anything is game -- from personal genetics to ways to digitize and track information, from how to self-diagnose to how to self-experiment with data and statistics. More specific topics include:

    self-experimentation
    using data and statistics to further self-experimentation
    behavior monitoring, tracking, and modification (including studying habit forming and breaking)
    lifelogging, lifecaching, and lifestreaming
    location tracking
    generating, capturing, and working with biometric data

    A venue for multi-disciplinary discussions that go beyond quantification of human biologic function to include ideas for how to optimize human performance across multiple domains including physical, mental, emotional and social.
    The presentations will span the gamut from the socio-cultural aspects of human health to the technologies and nutritional interventions that can enhance cognition, athletic performance and sense of general wellbeing.
    BioHackersNYC takes a broader view of biohacking compared to the original biopunk movement or DIYBio where experimentation with DNA and other aspects of molecular biology was/is a core element.
    It is designed to bring together multiple perspectives that can help shift the current health paradigm from an illness focus to a wellness focus.
    Anyone interested in the integration of sociology, biology, technology, wellness would find this of interest.

    There are tools that can effect both emotions and habits. Like brain mapping you will learn to capture your specific unique mind, measure effects and form wanted habits, thoughts and emotions. Place the palm of your hand on your forehead. You are now centimeters form your frontal and prefrontal cortex. This is only one brain system out of the many that produce your unique personality and habits profile. We will take abstract concepts and transform them through the knowledge of neural science and physics into powerful physical tools you can touch. Self directed improvement could be so much more than short-lived inspiration.

    What’s Missing From The World Of Self Improvement?

    In the age of brain imaging machines the last 80 years of Self-improvement has failed to provide a physical interactive tool to change your life. A system based on you holding the heart of your mind physically in your hands. For some seeing their personal memory-network in front of them can be an emotionally freeing experience. Left-brain processors will have the experience of profound intellectual insight. This group will help you achieve both while gaining real tools for shaping how you live and behave.

    Learning Labs

    You do perception and subjective information processing experiments while learning techniques of cognitive and behavioral change. Science combined with art to decode any problem or program your brain to attract what you desire. Not passive psychology or philosophy lecture, but cognitive science fused with art. Learn to produce everyday miracles of thought and action. Bring your problems or dreams and we will decode the answers. Learn to play away both simple to very complex problem in minutes. Tailored for you answers that are counterintuitive but really work sooner, rather than later. Self love, self esteem, dream building, remove addictions and habits, stronger relationships, super quality decision making, boost brain power, self-motivation are a water drop of what we cover. Hands on experiences you will want to share with both friends and family.

    STOP KLUGING

    KLUGING is a term from engineering. A KLUGE is a clumsy or inelegant solution to a problem. 99% of people interested in self-improvement are KLUGING together ideas from friends, their beliefs, pop culture, the media, and gurus.

    Do you already belong to 10 other groups that you never attend their meetups or you go once and never return? How many books have you read and continue to read following one trend after another with little results.

    This is a symptom of SELF-IMPROVEMENT KLUGING because you lack clear principles like “frequent behavioral neural plasticity” and “datapoints based measurement” for problem solving. This is the next step beyond “positive thinking and affirmations”

    Towards supporting habit formation based on the physics of “attractor stability.”

    NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD IS TEACHING THIS APPLIED KNOWLEDGE.

    ESCAPE KLUGING AND ENTER THE WORLD OF STRATEGIC PROBLEM SOLVING.

    Why keep trying in vain to change alone? In one group learn the Sciences of change by choice.

    NO MORE BORING LECTURE

    We will take abstract concepts and transform them through the knowledge of neural science and physics into powerful physical tools you can touch.

    We will learn how to measure different types of change using physical mediums.

    The BRAIN LAB GROUP will cover the entire spectrum: Self-Change and Transformation to Emotional Control, Relationship Building, Lifestyle Building, Wealth Building, Small Business Development, Strategy and Decision making, Creativity, Influence & Persuasion, Marketing & Selling. Create the life you want out of the raw materials of your imagination, time, and will power.

    The Beirut Quantified Self Meetup is inspired by the Quantified Self Europe Conference and the Quantified Self blog.
    Beirut QS is a local initiative to spread the self-tracking knowledge in the region. Being in a part of the world where self knowledge is not at its most, Beirut QS is trying to build a small community of self trackers, aiming to make it grow into a regional mindset.
    The meetup is a regular show and tell involving people who are looking to gain knowledge about themselves- or trying to learn how and why. QS is a love for numbers, numbers that are self-revealing. It is all about tracking data about our own body and analyzing for a better understanding of how we function.

    Anything is game -- from personal genetics to ways to digitize and track information, from how to self-diagnose to how to self-experiment with data and statistics. More specific topics include:
    * Self-experimentation

    * Using data and statistics to further self-experimentation

    * Behavior monitoring, tracking, and modification (including studying habit forming and breaking)

    * Life logging, lifecaching, and lifestreaming

    * Location tracking

    * Generating, capturing, and working with biometric data

    * Psychological self-assessments

    * Medical self-diagnostics and keeping track of one's own medical data

    The Louisville Quantified Self Meetup is inspired by the Bay Area Quantified Self Meetup and the Quantified Self blog.

    It is a regular show and tell for people who are tracking data about their body and conducting their own personal investigations and research into their bodies, minds, and selves. Anything is game -- from diet and nutrition, exercise, to personal genetics, to ways to digitize and track information, to how to self-experiment with data and statistics. There is a lot we can learn from one another and this group will get us started.

    More specific topics include:
    * diet, nutrition, exercise
    * self-experimentation
    * using data and statistics to further self-experimentation
    * behavior monitoring, tracking, and modification (including studying habit forming and breaking)
    * lifelogging, lifecaching, and lifestreaming
    * location tracking
    * generating, capturing, and working with biometric data
    * psychological self-assessments
    * medical self-diagnostics and keeping track of one's own medical data
    * personal genetics and genome sequencing

    Quantified Self is a collaboration of users and tool makers who share an interest in self knowledge through self-tracking.  You can learn more about this fast-growing, worldwide movement at http://quantifiedself.com .
    Self-tracking covers a wide spectrum.  Some are working to improve their health and fitness by tracking weight, exercise, sleep, or nutrition.  Others want to gain insight into their emotions.  Still others aim to improve their productivity and effectiveness by measuring how they spend their time.
    Our Portland group meetups follow the QS model -- a mix of short presentations, spontaneous discussions, and free-form networking.  You'll hear more personal stories and practical experiences than theoretical lectures, and demos are particularly enjoyable.  Anyone is welcome to speak - just email the organizer before the meeting.
    Whether you're already on a technology-powered journey to self-improvement, or just curious about the concept, come join us!

    Hi Everyone,
    Have you ever wondered why you feel the way you do? Is there a simple explanation for why some days you can leap out of bed and other days you want to hide under the Duvet? MoodMapping helps you understand your moods! It is unique, it is new and Dr Liz Miller, who hosts the London MeetUps has written about it in her new book MoodMapping.
    This group is to encourage people to find out more about MoodMapping and for people who have been to a workshop and want to stay in touch, to keep up to date, find out about future workshops and keep practising mood management skills.
    MoodMapping is an innovative tool to help people better manage their mental and physical health. If you haven't heard about it, it is because it is at the start of its journey! I am looking forward to hearing about your experiences using it. This group is to help build a community of knowledge around MoodMapping and how it can improve your self awareness, self management and self mastery.
    Mood underpins everything we do! and this is the place to learn more about it, and to learn basic mood management skills.

    If you are uncomfortable signing up through Meetup - email me directly on Liz@lizmiller.co.uk and I can book you a place for the workshops

    Best wishes

    Liz

    * self-experimentation

    * using data and statistics to further self-experimentation

    * behavior monitoring, tracking, and modification (including studying habit forming and breaking)

    * lifelogging, lifecaching, and lifestreaming

    * location tracking

    * generating, capturing, and working with biometric data

    * psychological self-assessments

    * medical self-diagnostics and keeping track of one's own medical data

    * personal genetics and genome sequencing

    Self-knowledge is key to understand how we interact with each others and the world around us.

    This group is how we citizens of Brussels are using cool hardware / applications / methodologies to better understand track (and subsequently understand) everything and anything about ourselves, our behaviour, the things we read, watch and hear.

    If you're a tracking hacker or just interested in the emerging movement of self-quantification, please join and share with an attentive and curious audience.
    Tweet using our hashtag #QSBXL so that we can keep track of our discussions.

    People who meet here are dedicated to living a quality life, for health and happiness.
    Join us and you'll see that we're passionate about a variety of ways to enrich our lives, share our wisdom and cultivate a community of like-minded folks.  Although this Meetup group is local, its content is connected to the web in a variety of ways.
    More of us follow a neo-paleo lifestyle, which includes key aspects of many dietary styles.  Strategies include...

    reliance on low-carb vegetables as a dietary mainstay,
    nutrient-dense foods (not just mineral density in vegetables),
    dietary variability (intermittent and partial fasting, seasonal eating, rotation),
    food as therapy (diet as first principle for wellbeing), and
    conscious food choices (avoiding ruts and autopilot, bypassing cravings).

    Conscious food choices may also involve...

    unprocessed, unrefined, "natural" foods,
    low carb, low glycemic, anti-insulin-resistance foods,
    clean foods (free of antibiotics, mycotoxins, added hormones, pesticides),
    sustainability (local, organic, biodynamic soil, regional, mixed use),
    ancestral strains (pre-GMO and pre-cultivation vegetables and grains),
    to grain or not to grain (avoidance, rotation, or selective), and
    to milk or not to milk (dairy choices, raw, cultured, etc).

    Joni's goals are to focus on:

    whole food eating and cooking
    nutrition
    wellbeing
    inner and outer exercise
    community
    sustainability, and
    consciousness and awareness

    Steve's areas of interest and expertise are:

    self-care modalities (being your own primary-care expert),
    quantified-self technologies (fun with gadgets and science),
    aging (mechanisms of aging, and how to age gracefully),
    neurodegerative diseases (Alzheimer's reversal and prevention),
    the FDA (the 23andme situation is just the latest),
    supplements (vitamins, minerals, nutrients, amino acids, etc.).
    metabolism (the "dance" of the body's molecules), and
    the body-brain-mind connection (spiritual health).

    Events (please vote!) may include:

    themed potlucks

    (please read our food guidelines under the PAGES menu),
    outings (hikes),
    field trips (to farms, Farmer's markets, stores),
    lectures, classes, study groups,
    evenings with authors, speakers, film makers, etc., and
    Dialog Dinners with featured guests at the head of the table.

    We'll post our own events, and those of others (for-profit and non-profit).
    Most of our Meetup events will be in the South Bay near Cupertino, but we do occasionally take a show on the road to Marin, the Walnut Creek area (where we used to live), and to other members' private homes when they want to host an event in their own backyard (or living room).
    If you want a raw-vegan Meetup group, please go to Joni's other group:  www.meetup.com/southbayraw. The South Bay Raw group does not mention use of meat/animal products.

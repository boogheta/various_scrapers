It is clear from Article 4(2)(a) of the Convention that JI can take place between Annex I Parties. Discussion on broadening JI to include developing countries was first initiated at INC-8, raising developing countries' concerns about its potential implications and impacts. Developing countries have viewed JI with varying degrees of skepticism and caution. Concerns have once again been expressed that Annex I Parties should not use JI as a means to avoid meeting their current commitments under the Convention and that JI agreements should not substitute for funding mechanisms under the Convention. However, the position of some developing countries appears to be changing. There are those who favor limiting the JI pilot phase only to Annex I Parties and others who are more amenable to the voluntary and equitable participation of developing countries. There appears to be some agreement among developing countries that the thorny problem of the allotment of greenhouse gas abatement credits and a ""baseline"" be excluded from the pilot phase.",5,Eleventh Session of The INC for the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)

While conceding the requirement for closed negotiations in the latter stages of the process, business representatives expressed dismay at the decision to go into closed sessions when negotiating positions of countries are well known. An environmental NGO representative indicated that the AGBM decision on access had been anticipated. Nevertheless, there were concerns that a precedent has been set - one that will not go unchallenged when NGOs next meet with the AGBM Chair and Parties. To the suggestion that negotiations might advance with more openness in closed sessions, an NGO representative said there had been no evidence of this to date. With non-groups working to cull down the number of positions in working texts, delegates and observers noted little movement on major issues in AGBM negotiations. Discussions outside the non-groups aimed at developing common positions among groups of countries have begun on such issues as the commitments of non-Annex I countries and the basis and form of emissions reductions.

While some delegates and observers are giving increasing attention to the impact on employment of potential AGBM outcomes, a number of environmental NGOs have argued that the issue is being manipulated to frighten political constituencies in developed countries.

Within minutes of the announcement, reports of counter trends emerged from some of the interested players who had participated in the Bureau meeting. Some said that a decision to limit the Protocol's objective to that set out in the FCCC could have implications for those proposals from regional groups and other Parties that stipulate or propose the development of formulae for setting a ceiling on GHG emissions based, for example, on sea level and temperature rises. Chair Estrada has, reportedly, argued that the introduction of a new objective may cause confusion. A number of the interested Parties suggested that the matter had not been resolved, and proposals containing new objectives would stay on the table at the AGBM. One regional representative said ""we have not given up."" They marked Estrada's announcement down to ""forceful chairmanship"" and suggested that he was somewhat ahead of the Parties in his reading of Tuesday's meeting. Some also conceded that, in principle, it would be advisable to restrict the introduction of new objectives but arguments would be made for an exception nonetheless.

There was some agreement that President Clinton has already succeeded in installing a significant amount of political insulation to protect himself from detractors - whether from the environmental or industry lobbies. The President has worked hard and fast to create a climate of opinion in which both the press and the public in the US have warmed to the idea of an international agreement. At the same time his administration has successfully dampened expectations among environmentalists by circulating memos and options which suggest that anything beyond stabilization targets will represent a gain - not least by the President himself.

Some ""disappointed"" EU delegates agreed with many of the facts underlying the US position, but said these facts were not properly reflected in the proposed targets. Recalling that the IPCC science calls for early action and indicates the need for significant reductions below 1990 levels, many said the US target, which is even lower than Japan's ""inadequate"" target, is a ""long way"" from this and intensive dialogue with all Parties was needed. Some developing countries delegates were not surprised by the US position and said the G-77/China proposal was intended to counter-balance it. One developing country observer noted that the US, in promoting its containment policies, has played several unilateral cards worldwide as of late and speculated that inflexibility in this forum could lead to failure. Another said that no protocol is better than a protocol with new developing country commitments. Environmental NGOs have begun preparing their strategic response, determined to 'salvage' the AGBM process and ensure that a reported 'celebration' by the business lobby on Wednesday evening was premature. Given the high-level nature of the US announcement, NGOs will focus their efforts on attempts to convince other Heads of State, such as British Prime Minister Blair and Germany's Chancellor Kohl to engage the White House. Japan will also face intense lobbying, as some NGOs have suggested that the host government for COP-3 had paved the way for the US announcement with its own 'extremist' position. The AGBM process is set to continue along parallel negotiating tracks, with 'megaphone diplomacy' punctuating the formal talks in Bonn and beyond.

Some observers suggested that a greater threat to the EU's coordination of a group position may be ongoing informal courtship of some EU members by proponents of competing QELROs proposals. A day after the US' expression of interest in differentiation, this hurdle to an agreement may be receding in discussions within the QELROs group. Some participants say that a narrow band of differentiation could make deeper cuts palatable for some countries, resulting in a greater aggregate reduction in global emissions than otherwise possible. Others would be satisfied if it at least makes it possible to reach an agreement that all countries can live with. Some participants worried, however, about the impact of an agreement based on differentiated targets. Pleas were heard that differentiation not become a loophole, as was the fear that providing a ""floor to ceiling"" range would encourage countries to head for the floor. News that Al Gore is to fly into Kyoto Sunday was greeted with speculation about the significance of the Vice President's attendance for the US negotiating position. Optimists were quick to suggest that Gore would be unlikely to attend the COP only to defend the current US target for stabilisation at 1990 levels. Instead, they argued, the visit suggested he might preside over an improved offer on GHG reduction targets. Noting that Gore would spend only eight hours in Kyoto, an NGO observer said she did not believe the Vice President would negotiate.",69,Third Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change

The proposers have, however, distanced themselves from suggestions that their proposal would set a reduction target for the US at 3.5 % and for the EU at 7.5 %. The EU has indicated that it will not settle for a higher target than the US.

One important example is the bilateral contact between the US and Brazil to discuss the fate of the proposed clean development fund.

The manner in which President Pronk intends to try to organize the informal high-level meetings is still raising questions among delegates. Many participants had arrived at the high-level meeting on Monday expecting to hear President Pronk's proposal on how to deal effectively with the many remaining key issues.

Also on a positive note, a number of participants felt that in spite of there being little new to report on substantive issues by late Tuesday evening, President Pronk's management style had at least produced a more open, relaxed atmosphere that was conducive to making progress in the remaining crucial days.

Key areas of contention include eligibility criteria on the mechanisms, the commitment period reserve under Article 17, applicable consequences in relation to compliance, and reporting on LULUCF and supplementarity.

Yet in spite of the quiet atmosphere anticipated in Bonn, the meeting was not without tension on its opening day, with many participants discussing the discord over two proposals raised by Canada and Saudi Arabia. The Canadian proposal is controversial because some observers see it as an attempt for Canada to gain further flexibility under the Protocol from its energy exports.

Further high-level discussions were taking place late on Thursday night on the entire package of issues. While news from the small group negotiations was positive, some concerns were being expressed about the dwindling numbers in plenary. Many ministers and high-level officials were left to address a largely empty hall, prompting several delegates to propose a more 'interactive' approach involving thematic roundtables and panel discussions. However, no one disputed the overall usefulness of the high-level segment, which increases visibility and political commitment to the process, and allows for a multitude of bilateral meetings to take place.

The first topic of conversation was the late start of the AWG's first meeting, which was pushed back from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm. The delay was due to disputes over the leadership of this new group that will deal with the sensitive issue of post-2012 commitments under Protocol Article 3.9. Apparently, there was some North-South/regional jostling over positions and also over the length of time the bureau would serve, with some preferring a one-year term over the two years served by SBI and SBSTA chairs. The consultations resulted in former UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar ' a highly respected figure in the climate process ' taking the chair, and Brazil's Luiz Alberto Figueiredo Machado accepting the Vice-Chair's post. However, disputes apparently remain over whether the rapporteur's position will go to a developing country or an economy-in-transition. There was also speculation over the next UNFCCC Executive Secretary, with some delegates noting that the UNFCCC Bureau had not yet been presented with a name by the 'powers that be' at UN headquarters in New York, although a shortlist was announced more than two months ago. However, one insider expected a decision 'within weeks rather than months.' Finally, early rumors about the possible venue of COP 13 and COP/MOP 3 in 2007 were already swirling, even though a decision is not due until COP 12 later this year. With 2007 being Asia-Pacific's turn to host the meeting, there was speculation that one south-east Asian nation might be interested.

In the words on one observer, it could require a 'superhuman effort' from AWG Chair Zammit Cutajar. Many were also focused on the possibility that the dark clouds gathering outside the conference center would soon become a feature inside, as the SBI turns its attention to the financial mechanism on Friday morning.

Some Annex I delegates indicated that they had hoped to achieve more on the identification of potentials and ranges for possible emission reductions at the Vienna session but saw this as increasingly unlikely on Wednesday as differences, for example, over the future role and development of flexible mechanisms entered the equation. Other delegates expressed a preference for modest conclusions from Vienna, as the alternative might result in taking forward a bracketed text to Bali. As one observer commented: 'If they can't agree, then let them say so.'

Several delegates were also warning that a very busy schedule lay ahead - especially during the second week. While some seemed very optimistic that an agreement on a future negotiating agenda and 2009 deadline for talks would be agreed in Bali, not everyone was so sanguine. ""A Bali roadmap would of course be the right outcome, but nothing is guaranteed in this process,"" said one veteran. Meanwhile, some delegates were noting the ""inauspicious start"" to SBI, with an agenda dispute over adding an item on technology transfer. While this new item had apparently been agreed by the COP earlier in the day, others were suggesting that it had been agreed largely ""because some parties were not paying attention in plenary"" or were confused about the proposal.

With the COP, COP/MOP, AWG, SBI and SBSTA completing their initial discussions, dozens of agenda items are now set to be taken up in more than 30 contact groups and informal negotiations. Many participants were complaining about agenda overload and fretting about how they could keep up with the many different but in many cases closely-connected discussions. 'I'm struggling to wrap my head around everything on the table,' said one. Meanwhile, a number of delegates seemed satisfied at least with the initial discussions on Wednesday regarding the various elements of the all-important post-2012 question, including the Convention Dialogue, AWG, and other aspects such as the Review under Protocol Article 9 and the Russian proposal.

With even more issues on the table than usual and the UN guideline limiting simultaneous formal meetings to two, many contact groups were much shorter than usual ' just 30 minutes in some cases. Most Chairs were quick to push discussions into 'informal' or small group consultations, where the rule limiting the number of parallel meetings does not apply. However, some delegates were wondering whether even this approach could deliver strong outcomes across all agenda items. 'Time is ridiculously short to develop text,' said one negotiator, while another observed that, with so many informal consultations, many delegates were 'double booked' and unable to give each issue the attention it deserved. 'I suspect that we will adopt a 'holding pattern' on some of the non-critical issues and push back real discussions to SB 28,' speculated one participant. 'That way, we can stay focused on the important post-2012 issues here in Bali,' she added. Meanwhile, several delegates were commenting on a local newspaper's front page story suggesting that developing countries had endorsed the GEF to 'manage' the Adaptation Fund, with some claiming the story was misleading and unhelpful.

Some observed that the language in the text was likely to be acceptable to a wider range of parties, thus making agreement more likely. 'Besides, this is just a draft ' anything could happen to it in the coming days,' added one observer. News that the Bali roadmap is to take the form of a 'President's Declaration' triggered speculation about the timing of the COP President's announcement. Some felt that the timing would provide an early opportunity for parties to respond to the proposal to use the President's statement as a device to wrap up elements of decisions of both the COP and COP/MOP.

Meanwhile, delegates were also discussing the Co-Facilitators' 'non-paper' on the Convention track distributed late on Saturday. While there was almost universal endorsement of the text as a sound basis for negotiations, the jury was still out on the ability of parties to project a common vision in a Bali roadmap. Some parties were already positioning themselves for several long days of talks, with initial sparring reported regarding language on targets, and which countries these should apply to. 'The text is a good start, but I don't think we'll see an agreement on the roadmap before Friday,' warned one. Some also predicted that the second review of the Protocol under Article 9 and even the AWG would be sent to ministers and solved at the end of the meeting.

Ministers met with the COP President's representative, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Wednesday. In what was billed by some participants as a 'stock taking' exercise, representatives moved towards agreement on the launch of a Bali roadmap, a timetable to conclude in 2009, the building blocks, and a two-track approach to the negotiating process. Ministers were also apparently informed of outstanding issues, including adaptation and mitigation, technology transfer and the role of finance. It emerged on Wednesday evening that two ministers had been invited to convene bilaterals. South Africa will convene bilaterals on the nature of emission objectives for developed country parties and on actions by developing country parties. Meanwhile, New Zealand will convene bilaterals on Protocol Article 9 discussions on the review of 'implementation' or 'effectiveness' of the Protocol. Speculation about the prospects for the Bali Conference intensified among those locked out of the ministerial deliberations and left to speculate. For those tempted to think the worst after the emergence of problems across the 'stumbling blocks' of technology transfer, finance, mitigation and adaptation, the words of one former senior UN official offered some reassurance: 'On the one hand, there are successful UN conferences; and on the other, there are very successful conferences.' Some minds have turned back to the negotiation of the Berlin Mandate and the lessons to be drawn for Bali. Some believe that too much content ' if only tacit ' has crept into negotiations on the future process, provoking at least one large developed country to join a chorus of heated warnings that they would entertain no text that would prejudge outcomes. Meanwhile, after the 'derailed' talks on technology transfer under the SBI and SBSTA, some delegates were also talking about another effort to reach agreement, this time under the COP agenda item on the topic.

The event proved so popular that the doors were locked and many delegates were not able to get in, congregating instead around TV monitors. Security was so tight that even the co-recipient of the Nobel Prize, IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri, had problems getting into the room. Many participants left the meeting enthusing about Gore's 'compelling' intervention echoing other calls to do everything possible this side of a US election, and to revisit the US role in twelve months' time. Meanwhile, as the deadline for a Bali deal started to draw closer, delegates were bracing themselves for some long discussions as they witnessed an 'intensification' of the ministerial-level negotiations taking place behind closed doors on Thursday afternoon and evening. A package of issues, notably linking the ambition of future targets for Annex I countries with 'new and additional finance' for developing countries, was at the center of disputes that have reportedly started to cause some concern given the amount of time remaining to secure a deal on the roadmap. Such is the temperature within the ministerial sessions that one industrialized country minister reportedly threatened to 'boycott' the next US-sponsored meeting for major economies, in Hawaii. On the G-77/China side, insiders are suggesting that the emerging package would include such elements as reduced deforestation as a part of non-Annex I objectives, new and additional finance for adaptation, and technology transfer, linked to mitigation objectives for both Annex I and non-Annex I parties. Developing countries were reported to be insisting on pursuing financial issues on Thursday evening before returning to the mitigation options. On mitigation and targets, a consensus was reportedly emerging among ministers on urgent action and the launch of a roadmap with an end date of 2009. It was also reported that remaining work included agreement on a package balancing Protocol Annex I (and US) commitments with enhanced action by non-Annex I parties. Agreement is also outstanding on the preambular text outlining the ambition of the roadmap, with the US and EU each offering different language. Ministers were expected to recommence discussions on whether to work on a comprehensive text, which would include process, building blocks and details, or whether to settle for a broadly-outlined process. It was also being reported that Ministers were issued a table setting out sets of options for commitments or efforts for Annex I and non-Annex I parties. At one end, the first option involves 'comparable commitments' among Annex I parties and 'enhanced and incentivized mitigation [that is] measurable, reportable and verifiable' in non-Annex I parties. At the other end, the final option would have both Annex I and non-Annex I parties taking on 'enhanced national mitigation action' that culminates in an international agreement,' with comparability between similar countries. 'The options are starting to become clear; which one they select is still anyone's guess,' said one negotiator. The news was more clear-cut earlier in the day on technology transfer, as negotiators concluded an informal agreement. Many delegates who had spent the last year working on the issue since it was tabled in Nairobi were showing clear signs of relief. Some movement was also noted on the issue of deforestation.

""It seems like they just want to know what kind of commitments the US will take before moving ahead and to explore different legal options,"" said one. ""To me, it sounds like they do not want any amendments to the Kyoto Protocol to be agreed in Copenhagen. Maybe they want to focus on the AWG-LCA and perhaps even explore 'softer options' for commitments,"" commented another. At the same time, the eyes of some developed country delegates seemed to be popping out of their heads as they tried to digest ambitious proposals for mid-term emission reduction targets for individual Annex I countries tabled by two developing countries under the AWG-KP. On the AWG-LCA side, some were commenting on what they felt was a lack of substantive progress. Others, however, considered this normal, saying that the objective of this meeting was only to elaborate on ideas for the negotiating text and properly switch to the negotiating mode in June. Also, many noted that it makes no sense for parties to shift their positions until they hear more detailed ideas from the US. ""At least we have 'seen' some very concrete examples of technology advancement,"" commented one appreciative delegate emerging from the AWG-LCA contact group, referring to the intervention by an Indian delegate who had brought an efficient but expensive light bulb to the meeting.",405,Fifth session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long- term Cooperative Action under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (AWG- LCA 5) and Seventh session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG- KP 7)

As there was still no agreement on Tuesday evening, some were willing to laugh about the irony that it would take a full session of informal consultations just to figure out whether, where and when to hold additional meetings before Copenhagen. ""Imagine if we had dedicated all this time to substantive discussions here,"" commented one. Others were already getting stressed about the hectic schedule emerging for the second half of the year. ""For us, additional meeting time in November is problematic because it does not leave us enough time at home to prepare and coordinate our positions for Copenhagen,"" worried some developing country delegates. ""Maybe it would help if we left a bit more time between the second additional session and Copenhagen."" ""Leaving the rest of the year aside, it seems like a lot of meeting time this evening will be required,"" sighed one AWG-KP delegate. The day's contact group and informal consultations had revealed divergent views over the documents to be developed for the June meeting, as well as on linkages with the AWG-LCA. ""And it didn't exactly help that we spent a long time playing 'musical chairs' trying to decide who gets to sit next to whom in the meeting room,"" commented one negotiator after delegates dedicated the first portion of the evening's informals trying out different configurations to seat like-minded countries together.

Many participants characterized the meeting as a significant step in the lead up to Copenhagen. ""We have Chairs' draft negotiating texts on the table under both AWGs and we also have the six-month rule to consider, so it should be an interesting meeting,"" commented one participant. Many expressed cautious optimism about what they felt had been constructive plenary discussions under the AWG-LCA. Although there were some diverging views over the contents of the Chair's negotiating text, most delegates were happy that agreement had been reached to discuss it further in informal plenary sessions. Some developed country delegates said, however, that they would have preferred to dedicate more attention to the legal framework, pointing out that only one hour of informals is currently allocated for what they felt was an important topic. On the AWG-KP, a group of negotiators joked that the two AWGs had ""switched places,"" with one commenting, ""everything looked so smooth in the AWG-KP last year, but now the gloves seem to be coming off."" The AWG-KP's opening plenary was delayed by more than an hour while parties consulted informally over mandate issues and the structure and number of possible contact groups.

Under the AWG-KP, some participants characterized the day's deliberations as ""useful but not too exciting."" Delegates spent the afternoon contact groups in largely procedural discussions on how to structure their work for the remainder of the meeting. While the ""other issues"" group agreed to prioritize LULUCF discussions in Bonn, the ""numbers group"" planned to proceed iteratively between aggregate and individual commitments. ""It was a good start,"" said one AWG-KP delegate, ""though I'm still not sure how the 'numbers group' is going to move forward - we're still looking at some pretty fundamental disagreements."" Meanwhile, informal consultations on how to proceed with the agenda and the financial mechanism under the SBI continued throughout the day, ""almost reaching agreement but just coming up short,"" according to one delegate. After its initial informal plenary session, AWG-LCA delegates were left with some food for thought regarding how to address issues and proceed after the first reading of the negotiating text. Some concerned-looking observers were heard wondering whether they would be sitting inside or outside the negotiating room when the second reading of the negotiating text begins.

He explained, ""I don't know if we agree any more, but at least we understand each other better."" A number of delegates seemed to be feeling the pressure, and some voiced frustration about duplicating discussions across bodies. ""Why are we still talking about adaptation in SBI when we talked about it all morning in the AWG-LCA,"" sighed one delegate. ""It's time to put some of these agenda items to bed if we're going to have the time we need in Copenhagen."" Many delegates appeared a bit hesitant to offer opinions about progress made or lack thereof, saying that it was still too early in the game. Some were looking forward with anticipation to the AWG-LCA informals on legal form scheduled for Thursday. The ""forest club"" made its first appearance today as the REDD and LULUCF discussions got underway. ""What are they talking about"" one bewildered observer was overheard whispering in the back of the REDD contact group. ""These people speak their own language,"" his colleague whispered back.

The meeting room hosting the lunchtime technical briefing organized by the AWG-LCA Chair was standing room only. During the event, delegates from Brazil, Bolivia, China and India made presentations on historical responsibility as a guide to future action on climate change. Lively discussions followed, continuing later in the corridors and even in some negotiations, including the AWG-KP contact group on Annex I emission reductions. One observer commented that notions of historical responsibility reflect ""deeply held beliefs"" for some developing countries who are unlikely to ""be pushed around"" on the issue. Some developed country delegates, however, were heard wondering when current responsibilities would be discussed. Some conceded that they could use a refresher course on the Convention as so many of the discussions are now centered on what is written in it - whether historical responsibility is included, and whether and how the various proposals under the AWG-LCA relate to the Convention's provisions. ""I'm glad that someone announced in yesterday's plenary that they have some extra copies of the Convention text - the Secretariat may soon be running out of the coveted booklets."" Later in the day, a number of delegates met in an informal group under the AWG-LCA to discuss the legal form of the outcome. Some emerging from the room afterwards seemed perplexed: ""For non-lawyers, it was certainty a crash course in international law."" Others, however, were excited: ""This was it! We have been postponing these discussions, but now the options are finally on the table, countries are speaking frankly about the options they prefer, and we're starting to address some real issues,"" commented one seasoned negotiator.

""It's true that we're finally getting into substance, and that we've managed to go through two very important chapters, but still, things are moving slowly,"" one delegate commented, continuing: ""But we had better brace ourselves for an intense second week if our aim is still to get through a second reading at this session in Bonn."" Most delegates did not seem surprised that the second round of informal consultations on the legal form of the AWG-LCA's outcome continued to elicit intractable positions. However, an announcement by a developing country that it was planning to present a fifth protocol proposal aimed at reflecting a broad range of views set the corridors buzzing, and caused quite a ruckus among some developing country delegations. ""Where did that come from?"" exclaimed one negotiator emerging from a coordination meeting. ""I guess the proponents are trying to ensure that a comprehensive legally binding outcome in Copenhagen is not precluded,"" said one seasoned negotiator. Some AWG-KP delegates were in a relatively positive mood, feeling that at least some progress was being made. Others, however, felt that despite more substance being added to the discussions, positions remained polarized. Some were wondering how the new paper, expected on Saturday, calculating a collective emission reduction range based on Annex I parties' unilateral pledges, would affect the mood. ""At least it will be useful to finally see what the numbers look like when the various base years and assumptions are translated into the same language,"" opined one delegate after the morning's meeting on emission reductions. AWG-KP negotiators in the ""other issues"" group were also looking to the future. Some hoped that they would start talking substance and narrowing options, after several days of running through the text and ensuring the inclusion of all proposals. ""It wasn't the exciting part, but it had to be done,"" one delegate noted, adding, ""If you lay a shoddy foundation, the house might crack later."" Attempts were also made to take some battles outside the negotiating rooms, as well as build bridges between some traditional divides. In the evening, a soccer game was organized with teams from the Secretariat, NGOs and the ""party of the world,"" consisting of delegates from developed and developing countries.

Reflections on the progress made ran the gamut from excitement to frustration. As mitigation discussions got going in the AWG-LCA in the afternoon, the plenary room filled with observers and senior delegates. ""Even though we're not negotiating yet, I can't help but be a little excited,"" one long-time observer noted. ""We're seeing history - the stone that will become the sculpture is right here in this room."" Some developing country delegates were less sanguine, with one stressing that although all the pillars of the Bali Action Plan are important, discussions on adaptation, finance and technology are still lagging far behind mitigation. Outside of the plenary, forest discussions continued. While delegates seemed upbeat after the REDD informals on Friday, some were less pleased with Saturday's deliberations, with one characterizing parts as ""rehashing Poznán."" On the whole though, delegates seemed confident that the Co-Chairs would help find a way forward, as many were quick to praise their ""remarkably balanced"" text on such sensitive issues. Some AWG-KP delegates also gathered over coffee to chat about LULUCF issues. A number of delegates felt the discussions on some issues were ""productive,"" and had helped to clarify proposals such as the bar approach. ""Of course, the hallways are the hallways,"" one delegate noted as he finished his espresso, adding ""we'll see what happens when the full group sits down together on Tuesday."" The week's intensive schedule took its toll on many delegates. As the plenary hall emptied after the AWG-LCA plenary at the end of the day, some prepared for the NGO party while others struggled to summon the energy to debrief the week's events with their delegations.

While the AWG-LCA completed the first reading of text related to the first three mitigation paragraphs in the BAP, some grew increasingly skeptical of the prospect of finishing the second reading of the draft negotiating text at Bonn 2 - ""I don't think we'll finish it here, but what happens if we aren't even able to finish it during Bonn 3?"" wondered one seasoned negotiator. Despite not completing comprehensive discussions of the mitigation text during the first reading, some delegates were glad the second reading of the adaptation chapter would begin on Tuesday. ""It's progress, but until everybody's words are on paper it's hard to see where this thing is headed,"" one delegate observed. Indeed, getting those words on paper to meet the deadline for submitting text set by the AWG-LCA Chair for Monday evening was a key activity after-hours at the Maritim: nearly every small meeting room was filled with delegates working into the evening to prepare their textual proposals. ""Looks like this is dinner,"" one delegate sighed, pointing to his cup of coffee as he hurried back to a meeting. ""It's only Monday and already it feels like those late nights at the end of a meeting."" Under the AWG-KP, a long contact group session convened to discuss Annex I further emission reductions, with several hours of further informal discussions on the topic scheduled for Tuesday. Some characterized the atmosphere during Monday's discussions as ""quite congenial,"" and parties could be seen looking relaxed and exchanging friendly banter afterwards. ""But obviously, there are still no concrete numbers on the table from all parties,"" one noted. Some developed country delegates also worried that the flexibility mechanisms were not being given enough attention, while others lamented what they felt was a too narrow mandate for the legal matters group. Informal consultations were also taking place on the upcoming sessions of the AWG-LCA and other bodies, including the Copenhagen meeting itself. The side-event on COP 15, organized by Denmark during lunchtime, was well-attended: ""I'm glad to hear that they are placing a lot of emphasis on good coffee and healthy food,"" commented one participant, adding that: ""Considering how tough Copenhagen will be, these will be vital.""",417,Bonn Climate Change Talks - June 2009

""Seems like I'll be missing tonight's buffet reception in honor of the Lady Mayor of Bonn,"" sighed one delegate. The REDD discussions culminated later in heavily bracketed draft decision text. With so many delegates happy about the first draft of the text, some expressed frustration about the ""explosion of brackets at the eleventh hour."" Informal consultations also continued under the AWG-KP throughout the day.

Delegates seemed reasonably pleased with many of the outcomes, including the agreement to reconstitute the Consultative Group of Experts on Non-Annex I National Communications. However, the evening ended up being long for those following the SBI, as the closing plenary concluded just before 11 pm. As the SBs gradually wrapped up, all eyes started shifting towards the AWGs.

However, some of those working closer to the source of the noise were not so understanding: ""I felt it was quite effective - if the aim was to prevent us from concentrating on our work,"" one delegate half-joked. Those following the AWG-LCA seemed already willing to reflect on the session's achievements and the possible way forward. While some seemed puzzled by the brevity of the second week's AWG-LCA plenary sessions, others praised the immense amount of important work that went into putting together the text, which has now grown to over 200 pages. ""What we did was useful - and going through the text in an informal plenary setting, paragraph by paragraph, would not have been helpful,"" said one delegate. He seemed optimistic that what might have seemed like a ""short-term loss of time"" could be made up for at Bonn 3. ""Realistically, not much more could have been expected at this session,"" another delegate added. Outside the plenary, one of the main topics discussed in the corridors was how the AWG-KP would move forward. During the day, the form and content of the AWG-KP 8 conclusions were being worked out in a series of informal consultations with the AWG-KP Chair. For some of those emerging from final informal consultations at around 8 pm, the mood was resigned: ""We couldn't agree on a mandate for the Chair to communicate text on possible Protocol amendments, so it looks like all we'll be asking him to do is to prepare documentation to facilitate discussions next time,"" one delegate reported. ""It would have been nice to forward jointly a legal text,"" said another, ""but it's a negotiation, and I see why others didn't want to.""

In particular, those parties and NGO representatives who attended the seminar on the post-2012 legal architecture, organized in Bonn last Friday, commented that the discussions had clarified positions and options for the legal outcome in Copenhagen. Turning to their expectations for this session and the road to Copenhagen, some delegates predicted that the session would focus on incremental progress in refining and streamlining the texts - with many worrying about the length and complexity of the AWG-LCA negotiating text. Others commented on differences revealed during the day's discussions under both AWGs on whether the session should be about advancing negotiations on the texts or just having general discussions on issues. ""Without some real work soon, it will be very difficult to get to a 30-page negotiating text,"" sighed one.

Others, however, were optimistic: ""This is exactly how I expected it to be at this stage - this is part of the process that we must go through to get to the next level."" As delegates dove deeper into the issues on the AWG-LCA side, the Chair also convened a session of informal consultations on the legal form of the outcome in the evening to continue discussions that began at Bonn II. Some, especially larger developing countries, continued to argue that the ""form should follow function"" and reiterated difficulties in agreeing on the legal form before knowing what the outcome will look like, suggesting the futility of continuing the informal group before Copenhagen for this very reason. Others, however, seemed frustrated that the conversation had not advanced since Bonn II, and that parties still seemed to be a long way off from reaching agreement on the issue. Some delegates commented on some shifting positions with some developing countries for the first time verbalizing their desire for a legally binding instrument.

Emerging from informal consultations under the AWG-LCA on the organization of work late in the evening, delegates expressed divergent views on the state of play under the AWG-LCA. Several characterized progress as ""painfully slow,"" while the more optimistic ones believed that the fruits of their labor would become clearer after the facilitators of the various informal session reported on inroads made towards consolidating text on Thursday. The issue of attributing proposals in the negotiating text came up in various AWG-LCA groups throughout the day, and countries reportedly debated over the topic in the evening's informal meeting. Developing countries cited concerns relating to transparency and complained that the negotiating text (sometimes referred to as ""the brick"") was ""confusing,"" with one adding that ""our proposals have been lost, issues dear to us have been marginalized and the text no longer represents the parties."" Many developed country delegates, however, disagreed. One delegate said he was ""floored"" by the issue of attribution since this was not what had been agreed to in Poznan. He explained that attributing text at this juncture would constitute a step back, taking into account the more than 2000 brackets in the document, and detract from substantive discussions. Sighing with despair he wondered: ""When will we ever take collective ownership of this text?"" Under the AWG-KP, the informal group on Annex I emission reductions proved popular as Annex I parties continued to clarify their pledges and the underlying assumptions. While some participants seemed almost excited, describing the sessions ""interesting"" and ""necessary,"" questions returned to reference years and the role of LULUCF. ""Without clarity on LULUCF rules for the second commitment period, the national targets are just not comparable,"" sighed one delegate. Another questioned the utility of discussing individual country targets, stating ""if we want to judge the effect of our commitments on the atmosphere, we have to look at all the targets together."" The role of carbon markets and offsetting also featured significantly in the day's discussions - especially as they were taken up by both AWGs. While the vast majority agreed that the carbon market will continue beyond 2012 and the main focus was on the details of the existing and proposed mechanisms, some more fundamental questions continued to float in the meeting rooms and corridors. One AWG-KP delegate expressed concern that, ""Annex I countries are attempting to shift the burden of mitigation onto developing countries."" Another voiced concern that the low-hanging fruit would soon be out of reach for developing countries.

Many were pleased with the progress on consolidating text under the AWG-LCA up to this point, noting that they had not expected to engage in line-by-line negotiations at Bonn III anyway. ""Fortunately it seems that we have reached the peak in terms of the length of text. At first I thought it was going to balloon even more, but I am comforted now by the very efficient work done on consolidation."" Others, however, were concerned that in the consolidating process, their proposals had been left out, and they were not so pleased with the process. In the afternoon, so many delegates lined up for a copy of the REDD-plus text that a second printing was required. Delegates were anxious to see how their proposals had been incorporated following three days of informal meetings with the facilitator, which many delegates felt were ""positive"" and ""reassuring.""

One delegate said, with hope, ""this text represents a solid chance to make some progress on REDD."" However, participants following some of the other AWG-LCA issues expressed frustration at ""beating around the bush on issues"" in some of the informal groups. One frustrated delegate stated that ""we can't continue to tinker around the edges of issues"" and eventually we will have to ""crack the tough nuts"". During the evening informal meeting under the AWG-LCA on the organization of work, delegates reportedly discussed whether they were comfortable continuing with the same working methodology in Bangkok as here in Bonn. Based on the fact that not all the sections of the text were covered this week, some suggested continuing the Bonn working method for at least part of the time in Bangkok, and transitioning into substantial negotiations after a few days. Some delegates expressed frustration with this, with one stating ""Why can't we just jump into negotiations on day one in Bangkok? We are wasting time."" Noting uneven progress in the informal groups, some delegates hoped substantial work could begin in contact groups at least on those issues where it was possible. One developed country negotiator believed some issues are ready to go for Bangkok, such as technology and adaptation and even certain aspects of mitigation.

The exceptionally busy first day saw the AWG-LCA barely pausing for breath, let alone lunch: less than half an hour after the opening plenary, parties were already plunging into the contact groups sessions - some of which lasted well past 6 pm. The atmosphere in both AWGs was also more electric than at previous meetings and several debates on sensitive issues surfaced during the afternoon sessions. Given that the EU and other developed countries expressed support for a single agreement, candid discussions took place under the AWG-KP on the Protocol's fate: whether it would survive beyond the first commitment period, and if not, what would happen to the existing rules, institutions and mechanisms, including the Marrakesh Accords. One senior negotiator worried that if ""Kyoto is absorbed into a broader agreement, are we going to have to renegotiate the entire thing?"" Under the AWG-LCA, the afternoon's contact group on mitigation proved to be fairly charged as strong divides persisted between the US and several other developed countries on the one hand, and India and many other developing countries on the other, concerning whether and how to consider common mitigation actions by all parties. Some delegates emerging from the room looked stressed or disappointed, characterizing the tension as a step backwards and feeling unsure as to where things were headed. However, at the same time, many also seemed excited that gears were finally changing and things were starting to happen: ""This is the real thing now,"" commented one inspired seasoned egotiator.",429,Bangkok Climate Change Talks - 2009

Agreement was reported from informal consultations by the AWG-LCA Chair in the morning to discuss proposals related to common mitigation actions by all parties in the contact group on mitigation. This started off the day on a positive note and cleared the road for scheduling meetings for the suspended mitigation sub-groups on sub-paragraphs 1(b)(i) and 1(b)(ii) of the BAP on Wednesday. For the mitigation sub-group on REDD-plus, Tuesday was already a busy day with two contact group meetings. One delegate commented that she ""felt like the REDD-plus group was the A+ student,"" as the group has shaved off almost ten pages of the AWG-LCA's negotiating text and has plans to start negotiating the consolidated text at its next meeting on Saturday. Many other AWG-LCA groups also seemed keen to get moving and establish procedures to delve into the negotiating text. This gave hope to some negotiators that substantial shortening of the negotiating text might be possible at this session, although others were still pessimistic about the prospects. On the AWG-KP side, the spin-off group on LULUCF met informally, agreeing on priorities for discussion and noting the anticipated submission of LULUCF reports from three parties on Wednesday. The group on Annex I emission reductions, however, continued broad discussions on how to get around long-standing issues, such as coordination with the AWG-LCA and top-down versus bottom-up approaches. One delegate noted that in order to begin working on text the group would first have to resolve the ""big picture issues"" - ""I'm just wondering whether, where and when that is going to happen.""",430,Bangkok Climate Change Talks - 2009

Delegates were, however, reminded of the urgency of their work, particularly adaptation for vulnerable populations, as news continued to stream in on extreme events throughout Asia, including typhoon Ketsana. ""While we cannot attribute individual events to climate change, this news provides examples of the kind of extreme weather events that we should be thinking about,"" said one delegate as he emerged from the adaptation meetings. In addition to several contact group meetings, the AWG-LCA Chair held an informal meeting on Wednesday afternoon focusing on the form of the agreed outcome. ""The legal nature of the outcome was not on the agenda, but we were discussing the document or documents that might come out of Copenhagen,"" explained one negotiator. Another remarked that it was difficult, if not impossible, to isolate discussions on form from discussions on legal nature, continuing: ""I think that the number of lawyers in the room might be a testament to that notion."" Exchanges in the room reportedly covered various ideas on the form of the agreed outcome, including: a single document; a series of documents on each element of the BAP; or a hybrid model comprising a core document and complementary documents that elaborate on the details. Building on these ideas, others mentioned a ""Marrakesh type"" of process. ""We are all chiseling away at the various pieces of the document to build a structure, but we don't know what kind of structure we are building,"" one exacerbated delegate said. Another delegate jokingly confessed to being perplexed by the variety of metaphors used: ""We talked about whether we are trying to build townhouses or a tower and about two elephants and how one would react if her elephant friend died. We also discussed mixing all the ingredients together so they are cooked before Copenhagen.""",431,Bangkok Climate Change Talks - 2009

Few, however, seemed to have a clear idea of how to characterize the pace of the negotiations. ""I must confess I am a bit confused,"" said one: ""Sometimes it feels like we've made a lot of progress - and at other times it seems like there will not be enough time to finish everything that needs to be done before Copenhagen."" Another questioned whether the consolidation exercise under the AWG-LCA had actually led to any shortening of the text, with parties insisting on keeping their proposals in the document. ""Well, we've indeed clarified our positions but this does not mean we've created any space for compromise, rather we've further illuminated our differences,"" he said pessimistically. Many of those emerging from the morning's mitigation contact group under the AWG-LCA were willing to admit that positions had been clarified - with some also conceding that ""important differences"" between developed and developing countries had been elucidated. Nevertheless, others were optimistic. One developed country delegate characterized the discussions as a ""fundamental breakthrough,"" noting that, for the first time, proposals for mitigation architecture were discussed in a formal setting and parties provided ""starker relief"" of their proposals and expectations. Emerging from the room, some delegates also remarked on Thursday's events in the US, including the introduction of the Boxer-Kerry climate bill in the Senate and the regulation of greenhouse gases by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act, wondering how these would impact the negotiations. Discussions also took place in the corridors and meeting rooms concerning the overall legal architecture and the Protocol's future. Some commented on new support for the proposal made by Tuvalu earlier in the week to consider the legal implications that would arise if the Protocol was subsumed under a new agreement in Copenhagen and how this would affect the Protocol's rules, institutions and mechanisms. ""There seems to be growing acknowledgment that this needs to be discussed - somewhere,"" said one party.",432,Bangkok Climate Change Talks - 2009

Many therefore considered the stocktaking exercises on Friday as important milestones towards measuring progress under each AWG. The UNFCCC Executive Secretary's press conference on Friday afternoon sent a signal of encouragement, as he expressed confidence that rules and tools can be developed in Bangkok and Barcelona will enable Copenhagen to succeed. ""Yes, we can,"" was also the slogan that a Swiss delegate displayed on the screen during the AWG-LCA's stocktaking session - a sentiment shared by many others wanting to believe that agreement in Copenhagen is still within reach. However, even the most optimistic were ready to admit that further progress during the second week will be essential. Many also suspected that such progress is by no means guaranteed. To be sure, pessimistic views were aired during the stocktaking meetings. Even stronger sentiments were expressed by some NGO representatives in the corridors: ""Progress is painfully slow, and everyone is chiseling away around the edges, and I worry that we are wasting time and money by being here."" Some veterans characterized progress as uneven: ""There are areas where we are advancing - but there are also crucial questions where we have not seen any significant movement."" Issues identified by some as areas where good progress was being made included adaptation, capacity building and technology under the AWG-LCA, and LULUCF and potential consequences under the AWG-KP. On the ""sticking points,"" many identified mitigation and finance as the key ones. Most predicted that mitigation would be particularly challenging to resolve: under the AWG-KP, the G-77/China said parties were ""stuck at a place where we cannot bridge the gap"" and reiterated the need for commitments by Annex I countries consistent with science. Some speculated how a proposal by the EU under the AWG-LCA to compile emission reduction pledges from all Annex I countries would influence the dynamics. ""While broadening discussions on developed country contributions might help, there is also the question of developing country mitigation to consider,"" noted another delegate. The breadth of the ground to cover in that area was evident from a comment by one developing country delegate on a proposal by a developed country on mitigation: ""The problem is not that I don't understand the nature of the proposal - on the contrary, the problem is that I do."" On the way to move things forward, the AWG-LCA stocktaking session bore witness to calls from some parties to give the Chair a mandate to consolidate the text further with a view to accelerating progress. As one delegate said emerging from the evening session, ""something more has to be done, this text still needs so much work, and it's now or never if we want to make progress."" However, several developing country delegates, while acknowledging that further consolidation was required, said the process still had to be ""party-driven"" and based on work done during the week.",433,Bangkok Climate Change Talks - 2009

On the informal side, groups convened under the AWG-LCA to discuss different aspects of mitigation, including mitigation by developed countries under sub-paragraph 1(b)(i) of the BAP. Delegates emerging from the informals on developed country mitigation reported that the focus had been on a new document indicating paragraphs that might be merged, and that the proposed technical paper on ""numbers"" had also been discussed. ""There seemed to be support for compiling the technical paper,"" noted one participant, but added: ""We did not really agree on the details, including the scope, methodology or timing of such work."" In the afternoon, the AWG-LCA Chair convened an informal meeting on ""organization of text."" One delegate explained that the meeting related mainly to organization of the AWG-LCA's work on finance and its means of implementation, which is reflected throughout the negotiating text. Delegates emerging from the room reported that no major controversies surfaced during the meeting. ""While many see finance as one of the ""deal breakers"" in Copenhagen, this was mostly an organizational discussion,"" said one party after the meeting. Overall, while several meetings were held throughout the day, many noted that the corridors of UNESCAP felt ""quiet and empty"" compared to the frenzy of activities on Friday. Many participants were overheard discussing their plans for Saturday evening (the traditional NGO party was featured at the top of the list) and for Sunday: ""I can certainly use this short break - next week will involve very hard work,"" remarked one delegate as she exited the UN building.",434,Bangkok Climate Change Talks - 2009

Inside the building, work resumed through various formal and informal meetings. Many of the day's meetings under the AWG-LCA were characterized by some participants as ""technical."" The AWG-LCA contact group on overall mitigation issues, for instance, focused on organization of text and work, and the contact group on mitigation under sub-paragraph 1(b)(i) of the BAP held a short meeting on the consolidation of the negotiating text. While the contact group on finance also held a rather technical discussion on a new non-paper, several delegates coming from the room were heard commenting on the new US proposal on finance. ""What I think is positive about the proposal is that it would be scaling up financial resources,"" said one delegate. Another skeptical one commented: ""I'm not sure how the mechanism would be different from the existing framework. It seems like the same game with a different name."" Under the AWG-KP, the morning's meeting on the relationship between Annex I parties' ""numbers"" and the market mechanisms proved so popular that an additional meeting had to be scheduled on the topic. After the discussions on issues such as environmental integrity, the impact of market mechanisms ""as the atmosphere sees them,"" the need for investment signals in the form of a carbon price and the role of ""hot air,"" many of those emerging from the room characterized the discussions as ""interesting,"" ""positive"" and ""useful."" One developed country delegate explained: ""Developed and developing countries still have different views on whether targets should be defined before the rules on other issues, or vice versa, and we definitely need to discuss this more. This was just the beginning."" ""Our views are still far apart, but it was a relatively good discussion,"" said another. Many informal groups also convened during the day, including on: a shared vision and sectoral approaches under the AWG-LCA; and on LULUCF and potential consequences under the AWG-KP. Emerging from the informal meeting on the scope of a shared vision, delegates were cautiously optimistic. One said: ""We had remarkably similar positions on the need for a long-term global goal to be at the center of a shared vision."" Another commented: ""While the form of the outcome is still up in the air and parties had diverse ideas on how a shared vision will be presented in the agreed outcome, there was new support for the idea that we are not going to Copenhagen just to create an aspirational and inspirational political declaration.""",435,Bangkok Climate Change Talks - 2009

Various contact groups and informal consultations were held throughout the day under both AWGs. Many delegates also made their way to the technical briefing by the International Energy Agency (IEA) on a special early excerpt of the World Energy Outlook 2009 to inform the negotiations leading into Copenhagen. During the briefing, the IEA conveyed a ""stark message"" that continuing with today's energy policies would lead to severe climate change impacts, while also highlighting a new window of opportunity to curb climate change and build a low-carbon future. According to the IEA, the financial and economic crisis has had ""a considerable impact"" on the energy sector, meaning that CO2 emissions are expected to fall in 2009, and ""with the right policies put in place promptly,"" this could help to achieve the IEA's 450 Scenario. While many delegates saw this as a cause for optimism, others were worried: ""I'm not sure 450 ppm will be adequate."" In the afternoon, AWG-LCA Vice-Chair Machado convened informal consultations on the organization of work for Barcelona. Parties reportedly agreed to continue with the current working method, comprised of contact groups and informal sessions. They also exchanged views on how to focus their work and identify key issues, given that the Barcelona session consists of only five working days. Several parties were heard expressing concern with the scheduling of meetings and the need to avoid clashes. Afternoon informal consultations were also held under the AWG-LCA's overarching mitigation group, which focused on proposals by several developed countries on frameworks for mitigation action by all parties. The meeting caused strong, albeit mixed, feelings among delegates. Some developed country negotiators seemed almost excited, and one was overheard saying afterwards: ""I feel we are moving to the core of the discussion now. It is difficult, but it's better to have this debate earlier than later."" However, some developing country delegates did not appear to share the same enthusiasm, with one commenting: ""Now I realize that there is not only one elephant in the room - there are several! So many of these proposals are clearly not fathered by the Convention."" Heated discussions on the fate of the Kyoto Protocol also surfaced during the day both in contact groups and in informal consultations. Some of those participating in the AWG-LCA sub-group on various approaches to mitigation commented on the proposal by the US to introduce language that would include the CDM in an agreement reached under the AWG-LCA. ""The US interest in the CDM is obviously welcome news,"" remarked one delegate. ""I am increasingly worried about the Protocol,"" said another: ""If we start discussing the CDM under the AWG-LCA, it means that the AWG-KP will just die - and I don't want the blood of the Protocol on my hands,"" he explained. ""It seems that many developed countries are ready to finish off the Protocol,"" opined another. The divide between developed and developing countries on the fate of the Protocol became more evident under the AWG-KP in the evening when a small group convened to discuss the legal implications of the Protocol being submerged under a new agreement. Several developing countries stressed that the question was political rather than a legal one, and opposed any discussions implying that the Protocol would cease to exist in the future. Several developing country delegates, in fact, reportedly walked out of the meeting after expressing this view. Several delegates, however, stayed on and held a technical discussion focusing on legal scenarios for the Protocol's future. Some developed country delegates emerging from the room, characterized the meeting as ""constructive"" and ""useful."" A developing country party, however, characterized it as ""enlightening, but scary.""

In the evening, the AWG-LCA Chair convened an informal stocktaking meeting. Many delegates reflected on progress made in Bangkok in the various contact groups and mitigation sub-groups under the AWG-LCA, noting that all groups had managed to produce non-papers, and that negotiations had begun in formal and informal settings based on these documents. As one veteran in the process indicated: ""Issues are on the table, we are discussing them, and have therefore entered full negotiating mode."" However, most agreed that the remaining workload before Copenhagen was still considerable. One delegate remarked that the text to be negotiated had not been significantly reduced and calculated that the various non-papers amounted to a ""staggering"" 177 pages. ""We need a radical shift in pace and volume of material,"" he indicated. Concerning an updated list of proposed new institutional arrangements under the various building blocks, some parties noted that it contained over 50 proposed arrangements. On the overall direction and progress of the negotiations, discussions at the informal stocktaking meeting were based on a note that compiled key elements in the issue areas. Several parties expressed dismay at progress made, with many developing countries arguing that they felt like ""the train was going in the wrong direction"" and that too many of the proposals were inconsistent with the Convention and the BAP. One went so far as to state that: ""We are moving farther apart instead of closer together."" Several developed countries maintained, however, that not a single of their proposals was inconsistent with the Convention and the BAP, and one indicated that ""if we all had the same understanding of what we adopted in Bali, we would not need to be here now."" ""It feels as if two worlds are colliding,"" commented one veteran negotiator emerging from the meeting. Despite the evident divisions and pessimism, optimistic delegates could also be found in the corridors. ""There will be a solution, eventually,"" said one.

Under the AWG-KP, an informal group discussed Annex I emission reductions, trying to narrow down the options related to the proposed Protocol amendments pursuant to Article 3.9. The group on other issues considered ways of streamlining the text on the flexibility mechanisms. The spin-off group on LULUCF also consulted informally. One delegate was in a positive mood afterwards: ""Progress on LULUCF at this meeting has been good and the rules are becoming increasingly clear."" On the AWG-LCA side, a number of informal and contact group meetings were held. By the end of the day, several groups had finished their work at the Bangkok session. In some of them, divergence was more evident than in others. Many seemed to place the group addressing various approaches to mitigation under sub-paragraph 1(b)(v) of the BAP into the category of groups where more work was going to be needed to reach an agreement. Many of those emerging from the REDD discussions also commented on new, ""almost surprising"" divides. One veteran NGO representative said: ""I don't think REDD can call itself the A+ student anymore. Old wounds were reopened on safeguards for indigenous peoples and conservation of forests, and some of the previous sense of progress was lost."" On the positive side, many delegates emerging from the sub-group on sub-paragraph 1(b)(i) of the BAP welcomed the announcement by Norway that it plans to increase its emission reduction target from -30% to -40% from 1990 levels by 2020. As the focus began to shift towards the next session, informal consultations under the AWG-LCA on the organization of work in Barcelona also took place in the afternoon. Emerging from the room, one delegate expressed concern with a proposal to replace some of the mitigation sub-groups with informal consultations and report back to a single contact group. She specified: ""Informal meetings produce informal results. We don't have time for such working methods."" Others, however, were concerned about the ""manpower"" required to follow all the groups and informals. A developing country representative said: ""Even if I could triple the size of my delegation, we couldn't cover all the informal groups that we would like to.""

As one delegate put it, the three-week intersessional period seemed like ""a long working weekend."" Expectations of progress in Barcelona, as well as in Copenhagen, varied. While many seemed resigned to the fact that a lot of work would have to be pushed beyond Copenhagen, others were angry at what they saw as attempts to lower expectations and the level of ambition. Mixed feelings were also expressed on how the work should proceed in Barcelona. While many delegates expressed hope that meetings would go straight to informals to finally begin ""real negotiations"" and facilitate development of text and clear options for Copenhagen, some delegates continued to highlight the need for contact groups. One stressed that ""a Copenhagen agreement needs to be developed in the light of day."" This sentiment was shared by some NGO representatives: ""If they spend the meeting in informals from Tuesday onwards, I will have nothing to do for the rest of the week,"" commented one. In the afternoon, many delegates found their schedule to be much lighter than expected: suspension of the contact groups and informal consultations scheduled under the AWG-KP at the request of the African Group took many developed and developing countries by surprise. The African Group insisted that the contact group on ""numbers"" conclude its work before the other groups proceed. According to rumors circulating in the corridors, informal consultations held in the afternoon did not resolve the issue. Reactions to this development were mixed. According to a developing country delegate, the cancellation of informal groups should not have been necessary and was not a good start to the meeting. Many developed country delegates in particular saw the move as a ""poor tactic"" and speculated on motivations behind it. Others, however, supported the position, calling it ""necessary and quite timely,"" and a developing country delegate said, ""this demonstrates that if no agreement is reached in Copenhagen, it is because Annex I countries have refused to make necessary commitments.""

By evening, a solution had been found and the AWG-KP plenary convened to clear the way for meetings to resume on Wednesday. After the plenary, delegates' views were mixed. A LULUCF negotiator explained that she had come to the meeting expecting the good progress achieved in Bangkok to continue and had therefore been disappointed with the suspension - and expressed relief that work could now begin. A developing country delegate analyzed: ""This gave this crucial issue more visibility, which is obviously a good thing."" He added: ""In terms of the time lost, however, I'm not sure it was worth it."" A developing country delegate expressed hope that this situation would not have to be repeated.

The AWG-LCA Chair also convened consultations on the organization of work. Parties emerging from the room described the meeting as focusing on the outcome of the Barcelona session with two options on the table: either having a draft negotiating text comprising all the non-papers or a report with the non-papers annexed to it. Discussions were also reportedly held on documentary form of a Copenhagen outcome. One veteran explained afterwards: ""A legally-binding agreement at COP 15 is now looking almost impossible, given the lack of consensus and limited time remaining."" Many, including concerned observers, were overheard wondering about the alternatives.

Among the meetings were informal consultations on organization of work under the AWG-LCA. Those emerging from the meeting in the evening explained that the focus had, again, been on how to forward results of the work done in Barcelona to Copenhagen, and how the AWG-LCA should work in Copenhagen. Opinions were reportedly divided as to whether to express the results as a compilation of non-papers annexed to the report of AWG-LCA 7, or whether a new information document should be produced. After the meeting, delegates also reported that parties seemed to generally agree to convene one AWG-LCA contact group in Copenhagen to provide an overview of the work that would be continued under the various informal groups.

With around 34,000 participants having applied for accreditation, COP 15 is by far the biggest meeting held under the UNFCCC. Given the capacity of the Bella Center to accommodate only 15,000 people and limited space in the plenary halls, some observers were already worrying about access to the negotiations and side events. Media accreditation also had to be suspended after reaching the 5,000 ceiling. The mood in the crowded corridors seemed to be one of anticipation, excitement, and even guarded optimism. Some wondered, however, whether the hopefulness would ultimately translate into political will to reach a strong outcome setting the world on the track to avoid dangerous climate change. ""The meeting is too big to fail,"" commented one participant. Several others appeared to be genuinely uncertain about what Copenhagen will ultimately achieve. ""Some of the high-level opening statements were less ambitious than I had hoped for,"" lamented some parties, with others alluding to ""mixed signals."" Many developed countries were heard talking about political declarations and COP decisions, with a possible roadmap for adopting a legally-binding instrument later. Others, however, especially vulnerable developing countries, continued working towards text that would result in a legally-binding outcome to be adopted in Copenhagen. ""Climategate"" was another popular subject, particularly after the call by Saudi Arabia for an independent international investigation of the work of the scientific unit affected. Although one scientific expert called it a ""tempest in a teacup,"" others worried that it could distract from the ""more serious"" work in Copenhagen. Some participants were also speculating on the source of the hacking efforts and related break-ins. Several participants were expressing surprise at the appearance of a prominent developing country negotiator in the delegation of Sudan. This fueled speculation that her role as a ""hardline negotiator"" for the South had been in jeopardy following pressure from certain parties. ""These kind of personality conflicts will happen more often now we're at such a critical part of this high-stakes game,"" said one observer.",449,Copenhagen Climate Change Conference
COP 15 - CMP 5,http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12450e.html,7-19 December 2009,"Copenhagen, Denmark",9 December 2009,"Much of the buzz in the corridors on Tuesday afternoon and evening was focused on the Danish text for a political ""Copenhagen Agreement under the UNFCCC,"" which was leaked publicly by the UK's Guardian newspaper. The initial reaction by many parties and observers was excitement as rumors about the ""secret"" Danish text were finally confirmed. Many therefore rushed to download or print out the document and study it. Some developing country delegates seemed angry at what they characterized as a ""secretive"" and ""non-transparent"" initiative. ""This would amount to hijacking the high-level segment and giving our leaders the impression that we have done nothing the whole year,"" alleged one developing country delegate. However, most veterans and observers close to the process were more interested in knowing ""which version"" of the text was leaked, and whether it was in fact the document they had already seen in November. ""Some changes, but nothing earth-shattering,"" commented a veteran developing country negotiator when shown the so-called ""new"" leaked version. Reactions to the implications of the leak and the substance varied. ""Now it is all out in the open - all the sensitive issues, everything. Maybe it will end up having a positive impact now that everyone has seen the text early on,"" was a comment that summed up some participants' views. However, others expressed ""outrage"" about what they saw as weakness in terms of substance and legal form: ""A political agreement with little substance, for instance, no range for developed countries' emission reductions in the text on a global long-term goal, is not strong enough,"" commented one observer. Others began speculating about how many more texts would be tabled during the Conference as rumors spread that several negotiating groups and ad hoc coalitions were in the process of drafting their own texts. ""I'm aware of four different initiatives,"" confessed an insider, ""And the last thing we want is a beauty contest over competing texts."" ""I wonder if we'll end up with the COP Presidency tabling a 'take it or leave it' text at some point?"" asked one participant. Meanwhile, some delegates were also discussing news that the US Environmental Protection Agency would be able to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act since they were now considered a threat to health. Some were speculating whether this might affect the US level of ambition. ""At a minimum it provides needed momentum and might provide flexibility in the US negotiating position,"" opined one civil society participant. However, others suggested that increased ambition is unlikely without concrete action by the US Congress.",450,Copenhagen Climate Change Conference
COP 15 - CMP 5,http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12451e.html,7-19 December 2009,"Copenhagen, Denmark",10 December 2009,"The corridors were buzzing on Wednesday afternoon following an ""intense"" COP morning plenary. Tuvalu's statement calling for parties in Copenhagen to sign a new legally-binding protocol under the Convention to complement an amended Kyoto Protocol, and to discuss this in a contact group, was the cause of the commotion. Many countries from AOSIS, Latin America and Africa were backing Tuvalu's call. However, several other developing countries, such as India and China, opposed the idea, fearing it would divert attention away from negotiations on a second commitment period for Annex I parties under the Kyoto Protocol. These countries stressed the need to focus on the AWG-LCA's outcome on the Convention's implementation, rather than adopting a new protocol. Tuvalu's call for a new legally-binding instrument also roused significant civil society backing. When returning to the plenary in the afternoon, delegates had to pass through a vocal crowd shouting their support for the proposal. As the demonstration was unauthorized, security guards promptly responded and kept the throng in the corridors and away from the meeting room. ""We are afraid this is a sign of increasingly tight security to come,"" commented one NGO participant. Other signs of the growing tension in Copenhagen included reports of non-violent clashes between civil society and a group of climate change skeptics. ""Things are definitely starting to heat up,"" commented one delegate. This was evident also from the fact that ministers and other high-level delegates have started to arrive in Copenhagen, including a Chinese minister and the US Special Climate Change Envoy. A list of Heads of State intending to attend the high-level segment was in the process of being finalized. There was also further fallout from Tuesday's leaking of the Danish text, with some delegates wondering who on the Danish side had been taking the lead, and several delegates from the South taking exception to the process as much as the substance. ""They should have engaged more with us,"" said one LDC representative. ""The group that was privy to this document was too exclusive and one-sided,"" said another developing country delegate. Many developed countries, however, continued to play down the significance of the text, as well as the leak.",451,Copenhagen Climate Change Conference
COP 15 - CMP 5,http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12452e.html,7-19 December 2009,"Copenhagen, Denmark",11 December 2009,"Much of the talk in the corridors on Thursday afternoon and evening was focused on the suspension of both the COP and COP/MOP, pending consultations on whether to establish contact groups to consider proposed new protocols under the Convention and proposed amendments to the Kyoto Protocol. As on Wednesday when the COP was suspended, Tuvalu led a group of African, Latin American and AOSIS parties in urging a formal contact group to consider the proposed Protocol amendments, and resisted proposals to move the procedural question to an informal setting with a review of progress in plenary on Saturday. Many noted that these disputes were closely related to the question concerning the legal form of the outcome: ""We have still not resolved the critical question of the legal outcome of these negotiations,"" noted one old hand in the process. ""Developing countries want to preserve and strengthen Kyoto, while most Annex I countries are seeking a comprehensive legal framework that also engages the US and developing countries in mitigation efforts."" Differences were also detected among developing countries as to whether the outcome from the AWG-LCA should be legally-binding. The wisdom of suspending work under COP and COP/MOP and its implications were also being discussed around the Bella Center. Some viewed the request to also suspend the COP/MOP as a good strategic move, while others feared it could delay work on other issues. ""It hasn't slowed the informals under the AWG-LCA,"" said one NGO who was supportive of AOSIS' stand. ""I'm just not sure how they'll break the deadlock,"" she added. Meanwhile, delegates were also reacting to the leak of a proposed outcome document - the ""Copenhagen Accord"" - by French newspaper Le Monde. The text, which was said to have been developed by China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, had apparently been distributed among G-77/China parties earlier in the week before the leak on Thursday. While the initial response to the text was cautious, some developed country delegates seemed positively surprised by what they characterized as a relatively ""realistic"" text. For their part, some of those connected with the text were playing down its significance at this stage, with delegates noting that it has ""limited status"" and is ""just a working draft."" People were also commenting on the increasing number of people at the Bella Center on Thursday, as more ministers arrived and delegations continued to grow. Lines to get into the building were noticeably longer than in previous days, and there was talk of limits on observer numbers next week. ""The place is already packed and there'll be thousands more next week,"" noted one insider. Rumors were also circulating about large-scale protests planned for Saturday.",452,Copenhagen Climate Change Conference
COP 15 - CMP 5,http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12453e.html,7-19 December 2009,"Copenhagen, Denmark",12 December 2009,"On Friday 11 December - the twelfth anniversary of the Kyoto Protocol - delegates were busy preparing for the arrival of ministers and the plenaries scheduled for Saturday. The draft texts tabled by the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP Chairs in the morning were among the most prominent topics in the corridors. At noon, the Chairs held joint informal consultations in the plenary hall to introduce their respective drafts. Parties' reactions varied. On the AWG-LCA text, several parties welcomed the text as a basis for continuing work under the group. However, some expressed ""surprise"" at the timing of its release and what they characterized as ""lack of adequate consultation"" with the smaller negotiating groups. While the AWG-LCA Chair stressed that the text does not prejudge the legal form of the outcome, the proposal envisages the AWG-LCA's outcome as a package consisting of a possible ""core COP decision,"" complemented by thematic decisions on the main elements of the BAP. Those calling for a legally-binding outcome in Copenhagen continued stressing their position, while many others seemed willing to accept an outcome based on a COP decision, at least as a short-term solution. Throughout the day, parties studied the details of the AWG-LCA draft in preparation for further informal consultations on the substance in the evening. Apparently, many of them found various issues that they characterized as ""seriously problematic,"" with some highlighting uncertainty over future steps to reach a legally-binding outcome and others stressing the text on mitigation as an ""unacceptable basis"" for discussions. The AWG-KP text was also described by some as a ""surprise."" While developing countries seemed satisfied with the proposal to the extent that it envisages an amended Kyoto Protocol, many developed countries questioned how this relates to their desire to have a ""unified protocol"" as an outcome of the negotiations. Some developed countries also expressed concern that the numbers for Annex I countries' mid-term aggregate emission reductions in the AWG-KP text were more ambitious than those in the AWG-LCA text. Work under the AWG-KP was suspended throughout the day. The ""numbers"" group convened briefly late in the evening, but was adjourned as the Umbrella Group stated they were not in a position to continue working until after having an opportunity to discuss the text with the AWG-KP Chair. Elsewhere, some countries and negotiating groups continued working on their own proposals, including one released by AOSIS during the day. Rumors also circulated that other groups and ad hoc coalitions might be coming up with text in the next days. Finance was another topic being discussed on Friday. Conscious of the importance of finance for a deal in Copenhagen, some were commenting on the deal on short-term financing reached at the EU Summit in Brussels, to provide €2.4 billion a year for the next three years. Many NGOs and developing countries were quick to label the offer as a ""token"" and stressed that ""much larger sums"" were needed. Some other delegates, however, were pleased to ""finally"" see some money on the table and speculated about forthcoming pledges from other Annex I countries. Elsewhere in Copenhagen, the role of private sector finance dominated the discussions as the various ""Days"" events kicked off with the Business Day. Taking the lead from UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer's briefing Friday morning, approximately 400 business representatives discussed ways that the private sector could contribute to quick-start activities. Existing sectoral initiatives, including for cement, were highlighted as areas in which the business community could contribute immediate action. Business leaders also emphasized the desirability of a stable, long-term government-led framework on climate change, as many highlighted that business cannot take the lead towards a low-carbon economy without a price being set on carbon.",453,Copenhagen Climate Change Conference
COP 15 - CMP 5,http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12454e.html,7-19 December 2009,"Copenhagen, Denmark",14 December 2009,"As the first week of the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference drew to a close, things were heating up both inside and outside the Bella Center. In the city of Copenhagen, an estimated 30,000-100,000 demonstrators marched from the city center to the Bella Center. A few hundred protesters were reportedly arrested by the police. However, the gathering was mostly peaceful with addresses and performances by a number of famous people. Climate change marches also took place in other parts of the world, including Australia and the Philippines. Inside the conference center, groups of delegates gathered to watch live images of the demonstrators. Many were heard commenting on the incredibly large numbers of people urging Copenhagen to provide a meaningful outcome and set the world on a path to avoiding dangerous climate change. ""It feels good to know that many people out there are as invested in this as I am,"" enthused one veteran negotiator. Meanwhile, many parties found themselves exceptionally busy in the negotiations, as they attempted to finalize outstanding issues under the Subsidiary Bodies, attend their closing plenaries, which in the case of the SBI, lasted until after 9 pm, and still make their way to the myriad of informal consultations and contact group meetings going on elsewhere. The emphasis remained on the long-term issues, which were considered throughout the day under various work streams. The AWG-KP Chair held an informal meeting in the morning, giving parties an opportunity to provide general feedback on his text introduced on Friday. In the afternoon, most AWG-KP groups began discussing the text, albeit with several parties expressing serious reservations to specific parts of it. Various drafting groups under the AWG-LCA also continued working throughout the day on non-papers covering detailed issues under the Bali Action Plan. The AWG-LCA Chair convened informal consultations on the mitigation part of his new text. Few delegates emerging from the meeting seemed surprised that parties had mainly repeated their ""well-known positions."" Some key developed countries continued to express serious concern with the mitigation part of the text and opposed using it as a basis for further work. In the afternoon, the COP President convened an informal meeting, also attended by some ministers. Parties emerging from the meeting explained that they had been presented a diagram illustrating possible outcomes under the Protocol and Convention tracks. ""The proposal was to either complete negotiations here in Copenhagen and adopt a legally-binding outcome under both tracks, or agree on a deadline for adopting a legally-binding outcome under both tracks at a later stage,"" explained one negotiator after the meeting. In their reactions, most parties reportedly reiterated their entrenched positions, with no noticeable shift. With little movement during the first week on some of the key issues, many delegates were thinking about the way forward: ""We must work hard so that by this time next week, we can celebrate a fair and ambitious agreement: the momentum generated for this conference is simply unprecedented and far too valuable to lose,"" commented one slightly concerned but determined party.",454,Copenhagen Climate Change Conference
COP 15 - CMP 5,http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12455e.html,7-19 December 2009,"Copenhagen, Denmark",15 December 2009,"As the negotiations resumed on Monday morning, the very large crowd of new participants who had arrived in Copenhagen for the second and crucial week took many by surprise. Even those who had already registered were forced to stand in line outside the conference center for more than half an hour to get through security. Those unfortunate participants without badges, however, found themselves much worse off: the corridors were full of talk about people who had spent between six to eight hours in registration lines - before being ultimately asked to return to their hotels. ""We were herded like cattle for the whole day! I couldn't even get a cup of coffee,"" commented one hungry journalist standing in line at the cafe. Some also claimed that the total number of people requesting accreditation had hit more than 40,000, thus far exceeding the 15,000 capacity of the Bella Center. Corridors certainly felt ""packed"" during the day - and some celebrities, such as Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Nobel Laureate Al Gore, were spotted amongst the throng of humanity. Other famous faces, including Prince Charles, were also rumored to be on their way to Copenhagen. Due to the large number of participants, limits will be placed on the amount of observers allowed to access the Bella Center from Tuesday onwards. With the high-level segment set to begin on Wednesday, increasingly strict restrictions will be introduced throughout the week and, according to unconfirmed reports, only 90 observers will be allowed in the conference center on Friday. Many NGOs reacted angrily to this and complained about being excluded from the process. ""I can't believe this is happening to us, it has costs us a fortune to send a team here,"" fumed one irate NGO participant. During a briefing by COP President Connie Hedegaard to the civil society in the evening, NGOs voiced their concerns over these arrangements. While COP President Hedegaard urged the civil society to keep up the pressure on governments during the last crucial days of the conference, she also recognized that access by observers and the media would be more difficult during the final days due to tightened security and also due to the fact that Heads of State would be bringing large entourages with them to Copenhagen. In the negotiations, substantive work on the long-term issues was suspended until late afternoon, pending consultations by the COP President on how to proceed. The need for such consultations arose due to ""deadlock"" between developing and developed countries: the African Group and LDCs, supported by the G-77/China, requested suspending all negotiations under the AWG-LCA. The move was repeated under the AWG-KP in all negotiating groups apart from the one focusing on Annex I parties' further emission reductions. The EU, Australia and other developed countries participating in the AWG-KP, in turn, found this unacceptable. Developing countries were ostensibly protesting against the arrangement whereby only AWG-LCA issues were to be discussed at the ministerial level and urged for more attention to be given to the AWG-KP. The issue was eventually resolved during closed consultations by the COP President in the main plenary, leading to an agreement to hold informal consultations on ""crunch issues"" under both negotiating tracks, headed by a minister from a developed and developing country. Many parties emerging from the meeting were heard wondering how work by the ministerial groups will be balanced against the more technical work by the various drafting groups, which is expected to continue in parallel with ministerial consultations. Nevertheless, work resumed under both negotiating tracks in the evening and the informal ministerial groups also began their work. Many drafting groups continued working late into the night. Many seemed determined to keep fighting towards a successful outcome and resolving as many issues as possible in Copenhagen: ""Nothing gets easier by postponing it, if something does not get resolved in Copenhagen - when will there ever be a better chance and more attention focused on climate change, including by more than a hundred Heads of State?"" commented one delegate, reflecting the mood by many negotiators.",455,Copenhagen Climate Change Conference
COP 15 - CMP 5,http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12456e.html,7-19 December 2009,"Copenhagen, Denmark",16 December 2009,"""The most hectic day so far,"" this was how many participants described the second Tuesday of the Copenhagen Climate Conference. Many delegates arrived in the Bella Center already tired from working until the early hours of the morning. Several drafting groups had continued late into the night on Monday, and some, such as the AWG-LCA finance group, pressed through the night until Tuesday morning. Delegates were, however, again kept busy until well after midnight, as the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA both attempted to conclude their work, decide on what to forward to the COP and COP/MOP as the outcome of their work, and hold their closing plenaries. During the day, some delegates, who were rushing between contact groups, informal ministerial consultations and informal expert-level consultations, complained that it was ""extremely hard"" to keep track of what was going on. The COP President's open-ended informal consultations in the afternoon seemed to provide some assistance, as parties heard reports on discussions during the informal ministerial consultations. On finance, for instance, it was reported that the issue of numbers for long-term financing, the scale of contributions and the countries that should contribute continued to cause disagreement. On a long-term emission reduction goal, consultations reportedly centered on issues such as the level of limiting global average temperature increase, whether 1.5 or 2°C. Under developing country mitigation, differences persisted, inter alia, on the nature, definition and scope of NAMAs. Ministerials on developed country emission reductions under the AWG-KP reportedly attempted to discuss how to raise the level of ambition of Annex I targets, but well-known differences persisted and not much progress was made. Outside the Bella Center, long lines continued at the registration counter and observer organizations were trying to get used to managing their numbers through the system of secondary badges. Difficult decisions had to be taken about those whose presence was ""very important. ""How do I tell the director of my organization that she won't be able to get into the Bella Center for her meetings,"" asked an NGO representative. Observers were also ""extremely concerned"" about what they described as lack of transparency at a crucial point in the negotiations. During the day, the atmosphere in the negotiations was sometimes described as tense and delegates appeared frustrated, not least due to the amount of complex issues still on the table, persisting fundamental differences among countries and the rapidly-approaching deadline. While the AWG-KP was able to close its tenth session just after midnight, the AWG-LCA closing plenary was postponed until early morning, as some parties had ""major problems"" with forwarding the proposed texts to the COP. ""I cannot believe that we haven't even opened the plenary yet,"" sighed one negotiator at around 4:00 am: ""This is not looking good."" Many of those fearing failure were, however, relying on words by the UN Secretary-General at his press conference earlier in the evening: ""We are here to succeed, not fail. The overwhelming response by world leaders to attend this conference is unprecedented and shows that there is political will and commitment to succeed.""",456,Copenhagen Climate Change Conference
COP 15 - CMP 5,http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12457e.html,7-19 December 2009,"Copenhagen, Denmark",17 December 2009,"""What a crazy day!"" This was how many described developments both inside and outside the Bella Center on Wednesday. As the AWG-LCA was winding up its closing plenary just before 7:00 am, other delegates began returning to work. At the same time, police had surround the area in anticipation of protests and possible attempts by demonstrators ""to take over"" the Bella Center. Indeed, violent clashes outside the Center between demonstrators and police punctuated the morning. Inside the building, two individuals also jumped on to the podium during one of the high-level national statements, calling for ""climate justice"" before detonating a ""sound bomb."" The beginning of the high-level segment in the morning was no less dramatic. First, COP President Hedegaard passed her responsibility to Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen - a development subject to a lot of speculation in the corridors and the media. Some interpreted this as a dramatic ""resignation,"" speculating that it resulted from tensions between the COP President and developing countries, or was prompted by a decision taken by certain Prime Ministers. Others, however, noted that they had been informed about this in advance, saying it was ""a question of protocol"" to hand the Presidency over to the Prime Minister as Heads of State start arriving. ""Be it as it may, she will still be heavily involved in the negotiations,"" commented one delegate. Another ""hot topic"" in the corridors related to the announcement by the Danish Presidency that it intended to table two texts as a possible Copenhagen outcome - something that many had already anticipated, or feared, following text leaked last week. Inside the plenary, many developing countries voiced their objection to the planned procedure. In the corridors, many were ""outraged"" at what they described as an attempt to sideline the work done by the AWGs. ""What is going on? What are they doing?"" despaired one veteran negotiator. ""Tense backroom discussions"" were reportedly occurring behind the scenes during the day to determine how to proceed. However, most delegates, even many well-known negotiators, appeared to be unaware of the exact details of these consultations. ""This has been an extraordinary day in the UNFCCC negotiations. My best advice is for us all to have a good night's sleep tonight so that we can come back tomorrow with renewed energy needed to complete our work,"" remarked COP Vice-President Figueres Olsen as she wrapped up the COP's evening plenary.",457,Copenhagen Climate Change Conference
COP 15 - CMP 5,http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12458e.html,7-19 December 2009,"Copenhagen, Denmark",18 December 2009,"On Thursday morning, delegates made their way through a snow-covered landscape to the Bella Center, many of them increasingly concerned about the ""precious little time"" remaining to reach agreement in Copenhagen on a ""vast amount of difficult issues,"" but nevertheless still clinging to the hope of ""sealing the deal"" on Friday at a historic moment in the fight against climate change. As they arrived, many noted that the large exhibit area leading to the meeting rooms felt ""eerily empty"" - not filled with energetic youth as usual. This was because strict limits had been placed on the number of observers allowed in the Bella Center. Echoes of their voices were, however, still being heard: many NGO stands in the exhibit area displayed the messages ""civil society has been removed from the negotiations"" and ""how can you decide about us without us."" The halls of the Bella Center still felt crowded, however: the artistic protests and large number of youthful faces were replaced by members of the press lugging television cameras and lighting equipment through the halls as well as large security details for VIPs. A number of the world's leaders with their entourages were also spotted rushing through the corridors as Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva, Felipe Calderón, Evo Morales, Gordon Brown, Hugo Chavez, Kevin Rudd, Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Evans Atta-Mills, Hillary Clinton and many, many others gathered in the Bella Center. ""Now we really are at the center of the world's attention - I do hope we will be able to live up to the great hopes and expectations,"" commented one negotiator. A positive step in that direction was taken as negotiations at the expert level resumed after the COP and COP/MOP plenaries were given assurances from COP President Rasmussen that work would be transparent and based on texts forwarded by the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP. Several informal drafting groups thus convened throughout the day, and late into the night. The high-level segment and national statements taking place all day and late into night in the main plenary hall were being shown on CCTV throughout the center. Most had large groups of people crowded around watching their leaders make impassioned calls to ""seal the deal"" in Copenhagen and take advantage of the unprecedented gathering of decision-making power. It was widely recognized that this marked the largest gathering of the world's leaders outside New York and therefore constituted a historic moment. Indeed, some softening of positions and progress could ""finally"" be detected from the statements by high-level representatives on Thursday. At her press conference in the morning, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that the US is prepared to work with other countries to mobilize US$100 billion a year by 2020. A financing announcement had also been made earlier by Japan to raise climate aid to about US$15 billion by 2012. In his plenary statement, French President Sarkozy also stressed the need for financing for developing countries and remarked that if keeping the Kyoto Protocol is what it takes, then the Kyoto Protocol could be retained. Reports on softening in China's position concerning MRV were also circulating. Many were hoping these announcements would have a positive impact on the negotiations. Negotiators were prepared for a long and sleepless night, as the COP and COP/MOP contact groups decided to continue working well beyond midnight. Rumors were also circulating that the world leaders were making their own efforts to work towards a deal. ""One way or another Friday is going to be a historic day in this process, and the whole world is pushing for us in this building to make it a resounding success.",458,Copenhagen Climate Change Conference

""But are our expectations for the COP and COP/MOP actually lower than they were this time last year and how much will we able to achieve this year? I am not so sure,"" commented a veteran negotiator. However, long-term issues and the two AWGs remained in the background as the first day was dedicated to the opening plenaries of the SBI and SBSTA. Both Subsidiary Bodies have what delegates described as ""extremely busy"" agendas. The meeting rooms were also crowded; the smaller SBSTA plenary hall was filled to capacity and ""overflow rooms"" were designated for those that could not find seats in the main hall. The reason was what some referred to as ""yet another delay"" in completing the international conference center in Bonn. ""We said our tearful goodbye to the Maritim last August when we thought we'd be moving into a new venue - and now we're having a tearful reunion"" said one delegate, who had to remain standing for most of the morning plenary session. On the substantive side, many delegates emerging from the flexibility mechanisms discussions under the SBSTA commented on what they characterized as ""increasingly political"" statements and criticism against market mechanisms by some countries, as well as ""strong"" disagreements over CCS and forests in exhaustion under the CDM. ""But we will be discussing standardized baselines under the CDM,"" noted one developed country delegated, seemingly pleased. In the evening, delegates gathered to celebrate the tenure of Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer and bid him farewell at a reception hosted by the German government.

One of the main topics in the corridors was, therefore, the AWG-LCA Chair's new draft text and parties' initial reactions to it. Some expressed surprise at what they saw as muted reactions. One developing country delegate explained: ""While the text was not as balanced as needed and the loss of a separate section on finance was a questionable decision, we can work with the text."" He added: ""In any case, the Chair had a difficult task to undertake."" Some participants recalled the reaction to the Chair's text at AWG-LCA 6 last June. ""This is groundhog day-I feel like I've already seen this before,"" despaired one participant. A concerned developed country delegate added: ""I don't think anyone wants to see this text balloon from 42 to 200+ pages over the next eight days as happened last June, but we do have to resolve some serious sticking points."" He continued: ""While working in one contact group twice a day may create transparency, I'm not sure when we are going to have time to actually negotiate."" A more optimistic delegate noted that ""something positive"" seemed to be cooking behind the scenes, promising ""perhaps a successful outcome could be achieved in Cancùn."" Over in the AWG-KP, parties remained unsure about the state of negotiations-including on the election of the new Chair. ""Progress"" according to one delegate, ""is dependent on how the mood evolves over the next two weeks."" However, some were cautiously optimistic, noting that significant progress on potential consequences means there is one less contact group to attend.

Others complained, however, that while the tone was ""mildly positive,"" parties had not really moved on from their ""entrenched pre-Copenhagen positions."" The assessment of a veteran developed country finance expert was that parties were ""pretending as though the US$100 billion pledged in Copenhagen never happened, or that the UN Secretary-General's High-level Advisory Group on Climate Finance has not been convened to consider sources of financing."" Many others, however, saw the various parallel initiatives, including the Secretary-General's initiative and the Paris-Oslo REDD+ partnership, as threatening the role of the UNFCCC: ""If these groups initiate institutions that start delivering significant funds while we are bickering, it will be hard to convince donors to bring the institutions into the UNFCCC,"" said one worried delegate. ""Déjà vu"" was how one delegate described the AWG-KP contact group on numbers, saying he felt ""extreme frustration"" that discussions seemed to be going round in circles ""as usual.""

They referred to the proposal by AOSIS, supported by some other developing countries, for joint discussions by the two AWGs of Annex I emission reductions. As one developed country delegate put it: ""We've been calling for cooperation between the two AWGs for a very long time - which is why I was pleasantly surprised by the proposal and that it did not receive quite as much opposition as I would have expected."" Other developed country delegates remarked, however, that there was still ""strong"" opposition to the idea of broader joint discussions on mitigation. Although some developing country delegates seemed very positive about this idea of joint discussions - limited to Annex I parties - some were wondering if it would be possible to get all developing countries to agree on the proposal. ""And then there is obviously the US - I am not sure whether they are willing to accept such discussions,"" commented one delegate, continuing: ""We have to see what happens when groups have had time to coordinate."" Some also made positive remarks on the agreement to reconstitute the legal issues group under the AWG-KP and on the LULUCF submission by developing countries: ""Things are suddenly picking up and discussions are becoming more animated and constructive!""",465,Bonn Climate Change Talks - May/June 2010

In the long-term negotiations, the optimism from Thursday's advances to find ""common space"" for the two AWGs to hold discussions began to wear off following the US intervention in the AWG-LCA and many felt that, overall, parties had mainly repeated their positions during this first week. ""I'll start focusing on next week, hoping we'll start making progress then,"" commented one delegate on his way out. Indeed, many seemed to be thinking about the future. The South African delegation demonstrated its commitment to a successful FIFA World Cup, which starts next Friday, as they observed ""football Friday"" by donning their national jerseys. Many attended Mexico's event on arrangements for COP 16 and COP/MOP 6. Some participants, especially those from civil society, expressed some scepticism over the plan to have side events some six kilometres away from the main venue. However, they reserved judgment, as the Mexicans said that the idea was to have ""one integrated conference,"" rather than separate spaces for NGOs and governments, and stressed that shuttle buses will be running continuously between the two sites. Some were also overheard speculating about the venue of the autumn negotiating session before Cancùn, with Colombia, Senegal, the Republic of Korea and China featuring amongst the names mentioned in the corridors. Quite a few delegates seemed to be placing their bets on China - while some speculated that backup reservations had been made in a European city already familiar to negotiators. Others were looking forward to Saturday's NGO party.

One developed country delegate explained: ""I am looking forward to next week, with the expectation and hope of even greater progress."" Several delegates also commented on the ""high quality"" of work by the AWG-LCA Chair in facilitating their discussions. Others felt, however, that some of the discussions were not as constructive, with some parties merely repeating their positions. ""I'm feeling like discussions have not progressed from last June,"" stated one developed country negotiator. Meanwhile, many activities also took place outside the negotiating rooms: Green ribbons were handed out by the Secretariat in honor of World Environment Day, climate justice activists protested outside the Hotel Maritim and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification held its annual Land Day adjacent to the conference venue.

An informal meeting on the topic took place in the morning and resulted in an ""insurmountable lack of consensus,"" according to one disappointed developing country delegate. According to delegates present in the meeting, different views persisted on the topic within the G-77/China, with AOSIS and certain Latin American countries strongly supporting the ""common space,"" and some other G-77/China countries continuing to oppose it. Many also felt that there was little indication from the US that it was going to soften its resistance to joint discussions with Protocol bodies. Several developed and developing country delegates expressed their ""extreme disappointment"" at this continued resistance. While many were skeptical, there were rumors that attempts were still being made to find a ""common space."" ""This is what we would need to make any progress,"" one delegate analyzed. With a focus on LULUCF in two AWG-KP contact groups within the last two days, LULUCF negotiators have been receiving unusually high attention. The G-77/China presented a common position on reference levels and parties began to open up on their reference constructions. ""At least some Annex I parties appear to be moving towards transparency in their LULUCF accounting,"" said one developing country delegate.

In addition to responding to the Chair's questions in the plenary hall, the AWG-LCA convened spinoff groups on issues, such as markets. The AWG-KP continued consideration of numbers and other issues. Some of those emerging from the informal consultations on the flexibility mechanisms said they were frustrated with lack of progress: ""We just picked up issue after issue, talked about and around it, and then moved on to the next issue, with no prospect of consensus on most issues."" Many said, however, that they were looking forward to the ""friends of the carbon markets"" party to be held later on Tuesday night. According to many parties, the day's most interesting event was the informal briefing by the UN Secretary-General's High-level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing (AGF) during lunchtime. The room was filled to capacity, leaving some participants sitting in the aisles and on the floor. The AGF reported that working groups on public and private finance have begun preparing a report on potential sources of finance, and envisage presenting the report ""hopefully before COP16."" In response to comments from the floor, the presenters repeatedly emphasized that the AFG is ""an advisory, not a negotiating body, and therefore does not address political issues."" Some parties and observers raised concern regarding the AGF's relationship to the Copenhagen Accord, and urged that work would be conducted under the UNFCCC. Others welcomed the work of the AGF and asked questions, including on additionality and environmental impacts of different sources of finance. One finance enthusiast lamented ""the irony of climate financing action being taken at the highest political level, while parties still cannot agree on the seemingly simple question of how to review the Adaptation Fund.""",469,Bonn Climate Change Talks - May/June 2010

One issue that will definitely be discussed at SBI 33 in Cancùn relates to Annex I national communications, as parties did not reach agreement on the date for submission and expressed different understandings of the proposals that had been made, making one observer sigh: ""After so many formal and informal meetings, it seems that parties have not even been talking to each other."" In the afternoon, many parties and observers were seen emerging misty-eyed from the joint SBI/SBSTA plenary to bid farewell to outgoing UNFCCC Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer. Referring to the shoes presented to de Boer by incoming UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres, one negotiator agreed that ""she really has large shoes to fill, but I am confident in her ability to do so."" In the SBSTA closing plenary late in the evening, strong pleas for a compromise were made in what some delegates described as a standoff over the proposal for a technical paper analyzing the 1.5°C target, under the agenda item on scientific, technological and socio-economic aspects of mitigating climate change. Those familiar with the negotiations expected conflict: ""I reserved a front row seat for the fireworks, but never expected a suspension of the SBSTA,"" said one observer. ""The varied interests of countries in the G-77/China are well-known, but it's clear that some of these differing priorities are becoming challenging to coordinate on,"" commented another participant.

""Unfortunately, it seems like we won't have time to discuss the paper in our groups tonight,"" commented one developing country delegate after it was announced that the paper would be made available after 10pm. ""I hope that we can still agree to use it as a basis for our negotiations at the next session,"" stated another. For some, the focus had already began shifting to the FIFA World Cup with several delegates spicing up their interventions with football analogies. Many were heard expressing concerns about whether the AWGs would be able to wrap up their business before kick-off on Friday afternoon.

The topic was taken up in plenary on Monday morning, with Saudi Arabia accepting the apologies of WWF and Oxfam International, whose personnel had been identified as the perpetrators. After the plenary, many delegates complemented both Saudi Arabia's deft diplomatic handling of the issue, as well as the response of the two NGOs in sending their top representatives to Bonn to apologize in person. While most participants were relieved that the issue had been amicably resolved, there was some feeling that it had taken up too much valuable time in plenary. A few delegates were also talking about the recent decision by the US Senate not to proceed with climate legislation this year. However, the response was more muted than some had anticipated: ""We've had a week or so to digest the news and at this point I'm not sure what more there is to say,"" explained one negotiator. Meanwhile, participants in the AWG-LCA left the meeting late Monday evening clearly frustrated at the confusion over the organization of work. ""With so many issues on the table, it's hard to figure out how to accommodate them all in the spin-off groups,"" sympathized one observer.

However, by the end of the day, discussions had entered negotiating mode. ""I'm happy to be talking about text. I was getting sick of negotiating how to negotiate,"" opined one diplomat. Not everyone was pleased with progress, though, with several participants in the finance group expressing concern that they were repeating some of the discussions from June. Meanwhile, several developed countries expressed satisfaction that the legal group had started its work: ""This finally gives us the space to discuss broader issues,"" said one.

""The texts will keep us busy in Tianjin,"" observed one negotiator dryly. The mood was not helped by some confusion about where and when some groups were meeting. Several delegates were complaining that they had missed the REDD informals, while others were seen shuttling back and forth from one room to another, in search of the consultations on form of the outcome.

Meanwhile, talk continued in the corridors about shifts in various groups' approaches to the negotiations. Several delegates were also detecting a more ""assertive"" and ""forthright"" approach from Japan, particularly with regard to the Kyoto Protocol. ""I can understand their position, but it will be interesting to see how it is received by developing countries in Tianjin and beyond,"" said an old hand in the process. For their part, Japanese negotiators felt their position had actually been very consistent over the past year, suggesting that gradual shifts in some other parties' positions might simply have thrown Japan's views into stark relief.

Yet, many of those arriving to the conference were not in an optimistic mood. Expectations for an outcome that is ambitious and meaningful enough to respond to the climate change challenge are much lower than they were in Copenhagen last year. For most, a positive outcome from Cancun would mean ""a balanced package"" on issues such as the green fund, a technology mechanism, REDD+, adaptation and MRV/ICA, possibly leaving more difficult but crucially important issues, such as mitigation and legal form for resolution some time in the future.

One observer queuing for the shuttle bus home had more general but important concerns: ""This is one of those days when attention is focused on technical details and legal and procedural complexities - I hope that the negotiators still manage to keep in mind the real reason why we are here: In eight days, we need to have a solid and effective package of decisions that will guide us toward a low-carbon future.""",491,Cancùn Climate Change Conference

The textual basis for work during the second week featured among the hottest topics in this respect. At her press conference, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres confirmed that the AWG-KP Chair would release a new text on Saturday and that the AWG-LCA Chair would also provide a new version of her non-paper. In response to rumors concerning a possible Mexican text, the UNFCCC Executive Secretary took a firm stand: ""There will be no such text."" Many identified ""balance"" as the magical ingredient for a successful outcome next Friday: ""We need balance between the elements of the Bali Action Plan under the AWG-LCA, balance between the two negotiating tracks, and balance between developed and developing countries' interests,"" noted one expert. ""Countries need to be equally comfortable and equally uncomfortable with the outcome,"" was how Executive Secretary Figueres defined a balanced outcome. The word ""balance"" was also an answer to some delegates wondering why certain issues that many predict will be among the key Cancun outcomes have received ""so little"" attention during the first week. ""I can't believe that today was the first time that REDD+ was taken up,"" stated one delegate. One delegate offered an explanation: ""Coming here, some of the AWG-LCA texts were much more advanced than others. Negotiators are trying to bring them all to a comparable level."" Another cautioned: ""Some of us are afraid that if we open up advanced text for discussion, we may end up moving backwards."" The AWG-LCA's work on MRV/ICA was described by many as one of the ""critically important"" but more ""immature"" elements of the AWG-LCA's work. ""The first version of Margaret's non-paper did not address MRV, but I'm trusting that the new non-paper will contain something interesting,"" indicated one party.",492,Cancùn Climate Change Conference

The reaction to the language was mixed. ""This is terribly weak,"" lamented some developing country delegates. One observer, however, said that important progress had been made. Many parties seemed to agree that there was limited time to react to the range of issues raised, although as one ""street-wise"" delegate put it, ""you can be sure we will have loads of comments when we have fully digested the details."" On the AWG-LCA paper, one seasoned negotiator noted ""is it a good text? No, but it's really our only option for moving forward."" The AWG-KP text should be available coming early Sunday morning. Getting ready for a transition in the process, some delegates appeared anxious to move past the unofficial spin-off and consultative groups of the first week and into formal negotiations within and between the two tracks. The arrival of Ministers in Cancun was another hot topic. Some participants noted that parties were already discussing what issues should be taken before Ministers and how this should be done.

On Sunday morning and early afternoon, they and the recently-arrived ministers had participated in the informal plenary called by COP President Patricia Espinosa in an attempt to search for further political guidance on the way forward. One delegate reported that during the plenary, COP President Espinosa announced a new working method to help move discussions forward that involved pairing ministers from developed and developing countries to work on specific issues. She announced five such pairs to work on: shared vision; adaptation; finance, technology and capacity building; mitigation and MRV; and issues under the AWG-KP. Other ministers could then provide support on other specific issues as they arise. Many parties seemed happy with the COP Presidency's efforts to ensure transparency: ""We're starting to trust that what you see regarding the process is what you get,"" commented one. Another remarked on the integrity of a single process that ""lays to rest the ghost of Copenhagen."" While many complimented this open process, some wondered how this would lead to decisions. ""I've been involved in dozens of international negotiations and in every case the work has ultimately moved to small rooms. It's still not clear to me how this process can result in the complex trade-offs that will have to be made with countries not facing a facilitator, but facing each other,"" said a veteran negotiator. Others began wondering about contingency plans. ""President Calderon of Mexico stressed his determination to get a decision on REDD+ during his speech at Forest Day on Sunday. Will the international community be willing to let a REDD+ decision proceed even if the crucial issues of the future of the Kyoto Protocol and MRV under the AWG-LCA are not addressed?"" asked a conservation NGO representative, who was optimistic on these prospects. Meanwhile, the WikiLeaks stories about Copenhagen and its aftermath continued to raise eyebrows among delegates.

At the same time, various informal negotiations took place at the Moon Palace throughout the day, with experts and ministers attempting to refine texts in preparation for the next phase of negotiations. The mood remained constructive in some informals groups, while in others, some parties reported ""a complete lack of progress."" Many participants having attended the AWG-LCA drafting group addressing texts on developed and developing country mitigation seemed satisfied that they now had decision text and appeared to be set to move to ""full negotiating mode."" ""Finally!"" exclaimed one delegate. Others cautioned, however, that the existence of decision language does not necessarily indicate progress, with one stating, ""Let's just wait and see. My impression from the meeting is that parties will simply add their options back into the text, which they have already started to do!"" Delegates attending the ""various approaches to mitigation, including market mechanisms"" drafting group noted ""a near-stalemate,"" and a couple of delegates emerging from the technology discussions said they were ""frustrated."" Given slow progress on many issues expected to be among the key Cancun outcomes, concerns were beginning to surface about whether and how all the necessary elements of the overall package will fall into place. One negotiator worried that the process might get bogged down in ""an attitude of no progress on anything until we have progress on everything."" Many seasoned negotiators acknowledged that it will be difficult ""to close the gaps,"" although there were some indications that negotiators were starting to identify where trade-offs could work between the different negotiating blocks, and some also began to contemplate ""Plan B"" scenarios. For example, some REDD+ negotiators were seen working on strategies to ensure that if a comprehensive decision cannot be reached, a simpler agreement to move forward on REDD+ could be ensured as a basis for the ongoing initiatives in many developing countries. One veteran delegate noted: ""Eager parties are redoubling efforts in an attempt to ensure agreement on REDD+ is not held hostage to other issues and they are simultaneously attempting to accommodate different philosophical views on markets and safeguards."" While most delegates began the journey back to their hotels after the AWG-KP's evening contact group ended at around 9 pm, some others, including the Secretariat, were preparing for a long night.

As anticipated, President Espinosa announced that the new AWG-KP and AWG-LCA texts were now available for delegates to start reviewing. Delegates' reactions to these texts varied: ""The texts contain many of the elements that parties have been pushing for and should satisfy most interests"" observed one optimistic delegate. A veteran negotiator also commented that ""the texts look much better and there has been progress on technology transfer, capacity building and adaptation."" Another explained that further work is still essential: ""We are not quite there yet, but I feel we are moving in the right direction."" Apart from the continuously intensifying negotiations, a large number of other events took place in and around the Moon Palace throughout the day. In the early evening, for instance, many journalists and observers attended a dialogue convened by Mexican President Felipe Calderón. In the first session on ""Consequences of inaction: our responsibility to act now,"" Heads of State from Ethiopia, Palau, Grenada and Honduras, as well as the Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union, presented testimony about the effects of climate change and described the adaptation strategies they are pursuing. They urged leaders to agree on more ambitious commitments to climate change mitigation and requested further support for technology transfer and funding for developing countries' ongoing adaptation efforts. Claps and exclamations were heard when President Calderón announced that payments to indigenous peoples protecting forests in Oaxaca will be made to neutralize COP 16 CO2 emissions. He invited Annex I parties to participate by also neutralizing their own travel emissions. Meanwhile, ministers continued discussions aimed at reconciling political differences, particularly on mitigation, finance, MRV and a second Kyoto Protocol commitment period. Informal meetings met well into the evening to resolve key sticking points. After one informal meeting on mitigation ended in the early evening, some described the mood as ""cautiously optimistic"" that Cancun will result in ""something we can all be somewhat happy with."" However, according to one delegate, ""anchoring the pledges and MRV, together with financing, remain problematic."" The question hanging over the Moon Palace was therefore ""What is on the list for a Cancun decision package?"" Delegates began to suggest that REDD+, a process towards the new fund, adaptation and fast-start financing were all nearly ready to go, but President Espinosa reminded delegates that while an agreement was within grasp, it was still elusive. Elsewhere in the halls, other delegates were heard bemoaning a lack of progress on adaptation in ongoing informal consultations, with one party noting ""we need to limit the damage at this point."" One old hand in the process noted that ""it's really difficult to tell how the process is going right now, because each of us is enmeshed in our own issues, making it hard to see how all the pieces will fit together.

Overall, the mood permeating the building in the morning was subdued with delegates reporting ""very little progress"" on many important issues. Meanwhile, Heads of State and government continued to deliver national statements, including Bolivian President Evo Morales who stressed the need to extend the Kyoto Protocol and ensure protection for Mother Earth. Other Latin American countries, including Venezuela, reiterated their positions on temperature rise and other issues but confirmed their commitment to ""stay in the room and seek convergence"" among the parties. Throughout the day, informal ministerial consultations took place in ""informal informals"" chaired by pairs of ministers from developing and developed countries on mitigation, a shared vision, REDD+, technology, MRV/ICA, finance, CCS amd response measures and adaptation. Some drafting groups also continued to make headway to refine texts to identify clear options for political decision. Reflecting on progress on Thursday afternoon, many continued to identify MRV/ICA as one of the primary sticking points. A senior negotiator noted that countries also continued to put forward ""strong and divergent positions"" about the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol. At that stage, others said there was ""little positive to note"" coming out of discussions on adaptation, finance and a shared vision. ""Compromise appears to be aspirational rather than operational in these negotiations,"" opined a delegate emerging from a ministerial meeting. Some NGOs representatives indicated they were increasingly frustrated with the delay in reaching decisions. Just after 9 pm, an informal stocktaking session was convened by COP and COP/MOP President Espinosa. Ministers leading the informal consultations suggested that while issues had been ""better elaborated,"" compromise texts on the Kyoto Protocol, mitigation and MRV had not been crafted. The stocktaking ended at around 11 pm with a reminder from President Espinosa that ""very few hours for actual negotiating"" remained.

The delay was due to parties' divergent views on the proposed agendas of the two bodies. In addition to modifications on the ""traditional"" agendas based on the Cancun outcomes, various parties proposed new items, some of them apparently controversial. Most delegates therefore spent the day either waiting for the meetings to begin, or trying to reach agreement on the agendas behind closed doors.

The SBSTA plenary got off to an early start, but the morning's discussions revealed differing views on how to proceed, including on REDD. Informal consultations therefore followed.

During the opening plenaries, a number of delegates voiced concerns over the lack of ambition on mitigation. Several of them also drew attention to data published recently by the International Energy Agency showing that in 2010, global greenhouse gas emissions were higher than ever before. In search of solutions, many attended a lunchtime special event by the SBSTA and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the new IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation. While the report reaffirmed the increasing growth of emissions, it also gave delegates some reasons for optimism. Messages from the IPCC included that the technical potential of renewable energy technologies exceeds the current demand and increasing renewable energy is therefore not so much a technical challenge as an economic one. The report also drew attention to the role that renewable energy could play in achieving low stabilization scenarios. ""That was an interesting event,"" commented one negotiator afterwards, ""but it also showed we need to work much harder on mitigation in the negotiations."" Meanwhile, the battle over the SBI and SBSTA agendas headed into day two. In the morning, the SBI opened and attempted to forge ahead, but was soon forced to return to informal consultations, which continued late into the evening. Late in the afternoon, SBSTA Chair Konaté announced that, while the question concerning REDD on the SBSTA agenda had been resolved, discussions on the forum on response measures continued. In the corridors, some negotiators reported that the key sticking point concerning the SBI agenda was MRV, and the proposed agenda item on a forum on response measures was controversial on both agendas. One exasperated technical expert worried that ""technical issues are being held hostage to policy debates,"" while another seasoned negotiator pointed to the ""proliferation of response measures"" in the agendas.

A number of them were frustrated by what one senior negotiator characterized as a ""rehashing of well-worn debates."" On consequential amendments, one said ""there are deep divisions on whether they are even within the mandate of the AWG-KP."" Meanwhile, the South African delegation provided a ""very comprehensive"" update on logistics for the Durban conference, leaving many delegates feeling confident about the logistical arrangements - entailing shuttles, bicycles and ""people movers.""",516,UN Climate Change Conference October 2011

""It's like asking if the chicken or egg comes first,"" noted one bemused negotiator, ""however in Panama we are asking if the draft text or discussion comes first."" With expectations running high, many observer organizations struggled to be accommodated in the first informal group meeting on REDD+. However, enthusiasm appeared to have waned after discussions, with some observers saying that parties were ""simply reiterating stances expressed in Bonn on financing options for REDD+."" Nevertheless, an expectation of draft decision text to be proposed by parties on REDD+ phase three (full implementation) was able to generate a modest level of anticipation in some quarters. On the Durban front, curious delegates lingered outside the heavily-guarded room where the incoming COP President, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, South African Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, held consultations throughout the day with delegations on country expectations for COP 17. Meanwhile, Denmark was lauded during the AWG-LCA developed country mitigation informal group and received the ""ray of the day"" award from the Climate Action Network for its unilateral decision to reduce its emissions by 40% by 2020.

""The texts are ballooning, instead of shrinking, it's never ending."" Agreeing with the sentiments, another added ""I shut my eyes and I feel like I'm back in Barcelona in 2009 and in Tianjin this time last year."" In the shared vision informal group, a new facilitator's note was distributed, which delegates reviewed and provided comments on. Delegates emerging from the meeting room expressed mixed feelings regarding the text. Some felt that it was a good effort by the facilitator in consolidating the various submissions, while others expressed more serious doubts and concerns. One seasoned negotiator said ""this text goes beyond what was agreed to in Cancun."" Delegates hoped that the renewed effort by the facilitator to come up with a new text would gain wider approval. In the afternoon, many stakeholders appeared to be excited about participating in the open-ended informal consultation with the COP 17 Presidency, building on the consultation efforts undertaken by the COP 16 Presidency.

Delegates singled out review, markets and non-market approaches and finance, in particular. ""It doesn't look like we will ever have any text on long-term finance,"" remarked one, ""we may as well pack our bags and leave now."" Some developing countries claimed that developed countries were reneging on their commitments, with one issuing a stark warning that ""without finance, there would be no mitigation, adaptation- nothing for MRV."" Meanwhile, developed countries reiterated their commitment to providing long-term finance, maintaining, however that the issue has been adequately addressed elsewhere and that there was no mandate to discuss it here. On the technology front, the atmosphere seemed more congenial. One delegate emerging from the informal group acknowledged slow progress, but added that ""compared to other groups, the technology group is doing well."" He said the informal group discussed text on the roles and responsibilities of the CTCN and that governance would be discussed on Thursday, with discussions on the selection criteria for the host to be left for Durban. In the afternoon, the informal group on legal options was once again filled to capacity, indicating intense interest on this issue. Parties addressed a non-paper, prepared by the facilitator, containing a ""menu of legal options,"" which for many was a modest step forward, setting out the possible options for a Durban outcome. The text was based on a range of views expressed by parties that included the following options: a legally binding instrument (LBI); and COP decisions, including a sub-option on a mandate to conclude an LBI with a clear roadmap. Ensuing discussions were heated. Many developed countries acknowledged, ""while a legally-binding agreement coming out of Durban would be ideal, it is unlikely to happen."" One developing country expressed that ""the political conditions were not right to agree to a mandate to conclude an LBI in Durban."" Many developing countries expressed their disappointment with the turn that discussions were taking in some of the negotiating groups as a whole, with no clear signal of will to sign on to a second commitment period and some of the Bali pillars, such as adaptation and finance, lagging behind on the road to Durban. As India put it, ""In some negotiating groups, we're really splitting hairs.""

The informal group on adaptation held marathon drafting sessions throughout the day, and were reportedly ""moving forward in a harmonious atmosphere."" One negotiator deeply immersed in the technology group for most of the day said ""We have made progress and have mandated the Secretariat to develop a paper on criteria intersessionally. The text as it stands is messy, but at least we have text that is moving forward to Durban."" Other groups had less positive news to report. In shared vision, for example, views on the scope of the shared vision remained far apart. One negotiator involved in the discussions said the new shared vision text is ""messier, more difficult and longer"" than the previous text, with ""parties throwing in issues that will never go anywhere."" A third iteration of the text comes out on Friday, and it remains to be seen whether it will actually streamline the submissions by parties or mushroom into an even ""more unmanageable text,"" in the words of another negotiator.

Many participants were speculating about what the meeting might deliver, particularly in terms of the future of the Kyoto Protocol and how it may link to some parties' hopes for a broader agreement down the road. ""The legal options negotiations will be critical,"" opined one negotiator, reflecting a widely shared view. Some experts noted the linkages between discussions on the legal form of the AWG-LCA outcome and the possible adoption of a second Kyoto commitment period. In this respect, some participants were discussing media reports that Canada planned to formally withdraw from the Protocol under Article 27 by the end of the year. Although Canada's lack of interest in a second commitment period was widely known (along with Japan and Russia), some supporters of the Protocol seemed to feel that the timing of this latest announcement would cast a shadow in Durban. Participants also debated the US position-repeated in its press conference on Monday afternoon-that it does not favor discussing a broader agreement at this time. The US prefers following up on previously agreed conference outcomes, such as under the Cancun Agreements. Some reacted to recent media reports that a number of developed countries did not foresee a broad agreement happening until 2020. ""Not acceptable,"" said one developing country delegate. Meanwhile, there were discussions about the last meeting of the Transitional Committee for the design and transparency of the Green Climate Fund, which took place in October. The meeting, which had aimed to conclude discussions ahead of COP 17, ended without consensus to adopt the Committee's report. Some felt that the topic could prove divisive in Durban, while others viewed it more as a ""bargaining chip"" to be traded off later in the negotiations.",524,Durban Climate Change Conference - COP17/CMP7

Observers highlighted a heavy workload that includes both various ""technical"" matters (including agenda items under the SBs, and operationalizing the Cancun outcomes), as well as ""political"" issues relating to the future of the Kyoto Protocol and a possible roadmap towards a future agreement. Meanwhile, delegates and observers alike were commenting on the significance of China speaking on behalf of BASIC countries on Monday. While negotiators for the G-77/China insist the original voting block will remain strong and intact, some participants wondered how a more coordinated position of BASIC countries might influence these negotiations. There was speculation over what will happen when the Green Climate Fund text from the Transitional Committee is formally introduced in Wednesday's COP plenary. There were rumors that it would be reopened, which raised concerns that this could represent a setback. Others insisted a full review would be possible in plenary. One negotiator suggested that South Africa is working on other compromise options but underscored that parties still had work to do.

Many observers and delegates from AOSIS fretted that the ""gigaton gap"" identified in a UNEP report would not be addressed without increasing the level of ambition from Annex I parties before 2020. While one participant supported advancing the agreements from Cancun, she suggested that ""we need to do more than this,"" particularly for countries facing climate impacts now. Another ""gap"" discussed by delegates was the one between the Kyoto Protocol and any future agreement. As discussions on market mechanisms kicked off, some participants seemed concerned that uncertainty will cause market instability and anxiety. Meanwhile, many participants speculated about how a package deal might start to coalesce. ""Ministers will be here next week and we really need to start connecting the dots,"" said one harried-looking delegate.

On the subject of forests, negotiations under both tracks seemed to move in a positive way, with delegates engaging in streamlining or drafting text. The SBSTA group on REDD+ welcomed a non-paper that advanced the Cancun Agreements' mandate. Some delegates even enthusiastically suggested bringing forward issues that had been intended for consideration by COP 18.

One experienced NGO noted that with many issues still left on the table, ""some negotiators don't seem to be aware time is running out."" At the same time, some observers felt that the defining lines of the negotiations were becoming clearer, while parties' positions did not seem to be softening just yet. The EU was purportedly putting forward options and consulting with developed and developing countries on possible elements of an integrated outcome. Delegates were also reflecting on the role of the South African Presidency, which continued to consult informally with delegates in a variety of settings, pushing them to go further. Some were also praising the COP President's efforts at transparency, although at least one negotiator suggested that such openness may have its limits: ""At some point we will need to go into small negotiating groups if we're to make this package happen.

That said, there was some excitement in Durban on Saturday, with thousands of protesters marching outside, while inside delegates worked feverishly on a multitude of texts. SBI and SBSTA plenaries met and concluded their work, although they forwarded several issues to the COP. With more than 130 pages of AWG-LCA text to review and revise, negotiators left the conference center late Saturday night with plenty of homework for Sunday and early Monday. Large sections of the text have been under discussion since Panama. However, parties will need to do more work on level of ambition, market mechanisms and long-term financing, among others, if they are to get to a ""party-driven, balanced and equitable outcome."" Under the AWG-KP, three options on the form and limit of a second Kyoto commitment period were emerging, though participants noted that no consensus had yet emerged. As expected, the COP Presidency quietly moved the ""indaba"" sessions among the parties behind closed doors to encourage frank conversations. Some delegations were suggesting that ""subtle changes"" could be detected and that, rather than simply making demands, parties were starting to seek ""mutual reassurances"" that divides could be bridged. The dynamics within the BASIC group were still unclear to some, as was the broader response to the EU's proposal for how a package deal might emerge and its desire for a timetable towards a broader agreement. As participants discussed how a package might take shape, many noted that the future of the Kyoto Protocol and its mechanisms are at the heart of the matter, along with operationalizing the Green Climate Fund and the other elements of the Cancun Agreements. Another major question being asked in Durban is whether the AWG-LCA will finish its work four years after it was created. Many felt it may need more time. The complexity of knitting these elements into a coherent and acceptable Durban outcome with just one week remaining has many participants worried. ""We see good progress on some technical issues, but the geopolitics are difficult and it is just not clear that all the trade-offs can be reconciled,"" said one delegate.

During press conferences, China laid out five conditions for participating in a legally-binding climate deal to come into force after 2020 and Brazil signaled that they wanted a ""robust, legally-binding instrument and not just any instrument."" The EU continued to seek support for their proposal on a roadmap for a legally-binding agreement, with several AOSIS delegates indicating their strong preferences for early action under both tracks and ""setting clear deadlines."" The US called for all countries to take on comparable legal commitments, even if the timelines for implementation might be different.

Some speculated that one of the candidates was only willing to accept the position of Chair and not Vice-Chair, while others mentioned that the idea of having two Co-Chairs had also been raised.

""The worst case scenario is that we leave Bonn without even adopting the ADP agenda if things continue at this rate,"" said one seemingly frustrated delegate, who went as far as to argue that a diverse coalition of ""anti-ADP parties"" were intent on obstructing proceedings. Another one remarked, however, that progress under the ADP is unlikely until more progress is achieved under the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA, especially on developed country QELROs. Enjoying a light moment, some delegates joked that the provisional ADP Chair [woman's] ample multitasking skills perhaps might be severely stretched in attempting to overcome the agenda impasse. ""Well, I've heard that the plan is just to get the process up and running by trying to resolve the organizational issues in Bonn and then hopefully adopt a programme of work in Doha before beginning work in earnest in 2013. If we don't, it's not going to be good for the process."" Whether the Bangkok session will actually be held is another area of uncertainty, with indications that the Bureau has yet to make a decision on this.

Their adaptive nature was truly tested during some well-attended informal consultations. ""There's only so much adapting one can do,"" joked one delegate on the lack of space in the negotiating room on adaptation and NAPs. Indeed, the space issue extended to other areas of the meeting, including thought-space, once again preoccupied by the crucial question of ambition. This time, the focus of attention was on the day-long ADP workshop, which was initially entitled ""enhancing mitigation ambition"" until some developing countries insisted on a broader focus, so that it would also cover means of implementation. Several delegates explained that the ""somewhat surprising"" significance given to the workshop's title illustrates the sensitivity concerning the scope of the ADP's work. Ambition prevailed as the overall theme during the event, evident from the scientific presentations, a further reminder that parties will have to start working to achieve more ambitious results well before 2020. As many developing countries continuously reiterated, the pre-2020 mitigation ambition gap is highly relevant under both the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP. It remains, however, highly contentious under the ADP, where the agenda discussions reportedly continued during the day. According to delegates, some developing countries continue to insist on the deletion of the item on workplan on mitigation ambition, while others argue for it to remain, stressing its key role in the Durban package. One insider explained: ""The difference is that the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP place the pre-2020 emphasis on developed countries, whereas the ADP is mandated to look at all parties."" Thankfully, in other quarters, the atmosphere was less somber than under the ADP, described by some as ""tense.""

As some groups under the Subsidiary Bodies concluded their work, the ADP continued to struggle to get substantive work started. After ""yet another round"" of procedural plenary discussions in the morning, the ADP moved into a smaller informal setting for the evening. Initial discussions during the informal meeting focused on areas where assurances on the agenda discussion are needed, including the ADP's role in enhancing ambition. Parties also reflected on ways to find a balance between the three working groups. Five proposals to move out of the procedural deadlock were also reportedly being considered into the evening, no doubt adding to the complexity of the task at hand. Reflecting on the negotiating dynamics, many delegates commented on the relationship between the three Ad Hoc Working Groups. Some noted that a ""nautical theme"" seemed to be emerging as some developing countries expressed concern over developed countries attempting to ""jump ship"" from the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA to the ADP when it comes to mitigation ambition. One delegate lamented: ""Developed countries seem eager to lay the AWG-LCA to rest and place the emphasis on the ADP; where is the equity in that."" Like any effort to navigate deep seas, a sense of direction and timing is key. With the morning report that an intersessional in Bangkok before Doha is now appearing ""unlikely,"" many delegates expressed an added sense of urgency for clarity on the way forward: ""These are indeed stormy waters for the ADP; it is difficult at this stage to see the horizon in the distance,"" opined one negotiator.",543,Bonn Climate Change Conference - May 2012

Expectations for Doha seemed to be mixed as revealed in the afternoon open-ended informal consultations by the COP 18 and CMP 8 Presidency. Many interventions reflected the fear that the lack of progress and ""procedural wrangling"" in Bonn had put the Doha outcome in jeopardy. Some also questioned what the ADP would be able to report to the COP as even the seat reserved for the ADP Chair on the podium remained empty and agreement on an agenda was still pending as of Wednesday evening. On the election of officers, an online announcement was made late in the afternoon that the COP 17 Presidency had informed regional group coordinators that the emerging consensus had fallen apart and in view of the ""impasse, the only avenue left is an election of the officers of the ADP Bureau."" It was also initially announced that the ADP plenary would convene in the evening. The news caused excitement in the Maritim: ""If a vote actually takes place, this will be the first time since the adoption of the Convention that such an event takes place."" Many began preparing for a long night, while hoping that a solution could be reached without resorting to a vote. Eventually, the ADP plenary was postponed until Thursday and uncertainty prevailed as to what the next day would bring. Informal consultations on the ADP agenda were also held throughout the day and continued late into the evening based on a new proposal from the interim ADP Chair. ""Thursday will be an interesting day,"" speculated one delegate, adding: ""My impression from the ADP discussions is that the dynamics of this process is changing and the majority of parties, both developed and developing, are gearing towards a new approach under the ADP that is no longer strictly based on the traditional distinctions between developed and developing countries, where common but differentiated responsibilities is at the core, as it has been in the past.""",544,Bonn Climate Change Conference - May 2012

After 9 pm, a group of relieved delegates emerged and reported that agreement on the ADP agenda had been reached. Moments later, rumors began to circulate that agreement had also been reached on the ADP's chairing arrangements. Meanwhile, the AWG-LCA closing plenary was delayed until past 10:30 pm pending ""brief"" informal consultations inside the plenary hall on mitigation workshops.

Some observers felt that a greater degree of convergence is occurring, while others struggled with the semantics of referring to text that technically, as yet, does not exist.

The high-level segment also presents an important chance for delegates to present ""knotty issues"" for resolution at the political level. Away from the media spotlight, a plethora of consultations continued under all five bodies, with many feeling that the clock was running against the negotiators. One delegate remarked: ""We've reached a stage where most negotiations are taking place in parallel, behind the scenes in informal-informals, so it is difficult to have an overall picture of everything that is happening, particularly under the AWG-LCA."" The need for clarity on the ""big picture"" was also picked up elsewhere. CAN emphasized, during its afternoon press conference, that closing the AWG-LCA is not just a matter of ""switching off the lights and leaving"" as all the negotiating tracks are linked and ""fundamental issues"" under the Bali Action Plan must be resolved. CAN identified finance as one such fundamental issue, calling for a ""credible trajectory towards 2020 with innovative sources of financing from a levy on international air and maritime transport, as well as a financial transaction tax."" As if anticipating this call for mid-term finance, rumors circulated that the UK has become the first EU member state to make a pledge of post-2012 finance totaling € 2.2 billion.

The Chinese representative discussed plans for domestic emissions trading and energy efficiency initiatives, also highlighting the need to raise developed countries' mitigation ambition which will stimulate demand for credits from international market mechanisms. Representatives from Australia and the EU highlighted the decision to link their respective emission trading schemes and form the world's largest carbon market.

SBSTA moved smoothly, albeit slower than some wished, while the SBI plenary barely took a step before being stopped in its tracks. Overall, there was a feeling of frustration - or perhaps boredom - with the lack of progress, possibly caused by the latest SBI procedural wrangling. Two participants labeled this turn of events as ""disappointing"" as they had hoped for a ""focused and productive"" SBI session. One optimistic delegate noted that it is ""only the first day,"" but others expressed fear ""that at this pace we will never reach agreement by 2015."" Heading out to the reception, some delegates remarked that they would do their best to follow the SBI Chair's advice and ""rid themselves of the bad ghosts of the past"" to overcome the SBI impasse.",570,Bonn Climate Change Conference - June 2013

In the ADP, as one participant expressed, ""some countries' proposals are constructive and we can see efforts to find some middle ground between top-down and bottom-up approaches."" Another, however, was less convinced that progress was being made, and opined that the discussions added little to last month's positions. Work also continued under SBSTA. Multiple groups began meeting as delegates ""rolled up their sleeves and got down to business,"" as one REDD+ negotiator put it, as he left the drafting group room late in the night. Meanwhile, the prevailing SBI impasse continued. Looking ahead to Wednesday, one participant remarked that convening the workshop on the 2013-2015 Review was timely, given the recorded atmospheric concentration of 400ppm of carbon dioxide, which now gave the Review ""extra gravitas.""",571,Bonn Climate Change Conference - June 2013

However, the warm glow had worn off when the SBI's late afternoon plenary convened and it was formally confirmed that a resolution to the agenda dispute had yet to be found. Chair Chruszczow, who one delegate characterized as ""evidently a very busy diplomat,"" explained that he was pleased to see that some key parties were now eager to talk, but lamented that divergent views had still not been bridged. Some scheduled workshops, such as the Article 6 Dialogue and REDD+, will go ahead but others, such as on NAMAs, cannot be held as they would need to be formally included in the SBI agenda. Some participants seemed resigned to the impasse, with one delegate highlighting that he was ""happy to see some steps being taken in the right direction,"" reflecting, however, on how long it would take to reach agreement when positions seemed just as entrenched as ever.",572,Bonn Climate Change Conference - June 2013

Poland reassured attendees of a transparent, inclusive and party-driven process, as well as facilitation of a meaningful stakeholder engagement. Expectations for the meeting, however, diverged; for instance, while a developing country delegate labeled COP 19 the ""Finance COP,"" emphasizing means of implementation through scaled-up finance and technology transfer; another said: ""COP 19 is the moment for establishing a loss and damage mechanism,"" and yet another emphasized that CBDR is key, and COP 19 should focus on enhanced action for the implementation of the Convention. Developed countries also seemed to have their own views on what to expect from COP 19, with a group of delegates noting that, in Warsaw, making progress on market mechanisms and MRV and ""agreeing on a work process that builds a foundation for a legally binding agreement applicable to all parties"" will be key. Meanwhile the evening informal SBI consultation convened on the agenda was not able to yield good news.

A vote on appealing the SBI chair's decision to allow further interventions on the agenda item proposed by the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Belarus prompted some to call this vote ""unprecedented."" However, some climate veterans recalled that this was not the first time a vote had taken place during UNFCCC negotiations, with one negotiator remembering a COP 2 vote on the location of the Secretariat. In the hallway, debates on the pros and cons of voting in the climate process ensued. One delegate opined that some fear that the issue of voting could set a ""dangerous precedent of creating procedural winners and losers, when what we need is a strong collective effort."" In the evening friends of the chair group, tasked with discussing the issue, delegates reportedly had difficulty finding an amicable solution. On the table there were some options, including: considering the proposal as a formal sub-item under the agenda item on intergovernmental arrangements; including a footnote; or adding elaborated text in the annotated agenda. At this stage, it seems clear for many that the discussion is much more than just about the agenda. While many continued to speculate on the proponents' objectives, others debated the end result.

Some opined that ""positive spirits"" had prevailed in most SBSTA discussions and substantive progress appeared within reach. A delegate's reflection on the ongoing work under the Nairobi Work Programme (NWP) on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change was hopeful: ""I think we are making progress towards a second phase of the NWP. I hope we will manage to bring it closer to the implementation needs on the ground."" Those following REDD+ were pleased that outstanding tasks, such as MRV, national monitoring systems, and time and frequency of the presentation of information on safeguards, had advanced substantially. However, agriculture under the SBSTA was cited as an issue that was not progressing as smoothly as most hoped. Meanwhile, on the SBI side of the corridor, delegates continued meeting in a Friends of the Chair group all day, with many delegates becoming increasingly frustrated with the impasse, as one voiced: ""can you imagine how much work we'll have to do in Warsaw to make up for lost time?"" Another veteran negotiator explained that despite the SBI Chair's conciliatory proposals, ""none of the alternatives proposed seemed to satisfy parties' interests,"" but ""hopefully, all challenges would be overcome by Monday or Tuesday."" The ADP co-chairs' lunchtime civil society event was well attended, with some participants wondering if, perhaps, progress within the UNFCCC is being outpaced by initiatives outside the process. As one BINGOs representative put it: ""we can, we are and we will"" stay committed to tackling climate change. CAN announced an ""informal process"" to develop an equity-based framework. Local Governments, Women and Gender, and Climate Justice Now! joined in by highlighting their numerous activities. Participants also discussed elements for a 2015 agreement and reflected on their common wish for a more transparent, structured approach to civil society engagement. ""It's what we all want,"" another emphasized. In this spirit, Mexico, for the EIG, announced that they will submit a proposal calling for a platform for continuous dialogue with civil society.

Emerging from the room, one delegate said ""enough is enough,"" proclaiming that the only way forward now would be to resume discussions in a plenary setting. While delegates continue attempts to thrash out how to continue work under the SBI and ADP, international media attention, notably absent from Bonn, focused on the new International Energy Agency report, indicating that GHG emissions from fossil fuel use rose to record levels in 2012 and warning that the world is heading for between 3.6°C and 5.3°C warming - way above the agreed UNFCCC target of keeping the global average temperature rise below 2°C from pre-industrial times. The report also urges countries and companies to, among other things: implement aggressive energy-efficiency measures; reduce the release of methane in oil and gas operations; and phase out fossil-fuel subsidies. On a lighter note, a GRULAC lunchtime meeting was successful in agreeing that Peru will host COP 20 and the pre-COP will be held in Venezuela.

An SBI plenary session characterized by emotional exchanges left many reeling and contemplating the implications of the fact that the SBI will not be able to launch substantive work in Bonn and the inevitable repercussions of this down the line. One negotiator reflected on the irony of imploring the SBI Chair to ""gavel us out of here without a consensus, when it was hasty gaveling in Doha that created this mess in the first place."" Managing to muster some optimism, he added that delegates would inevitably ""have to pick up the pieces in Warsaw."" For several delegates, the implications of ""Terrible Tuesday"" were more immediate, with one delegate ruefully declaring ""this is a sad day for the process; the world is watching us and will think the worst."" Another delegate added that the SBI standoff could ""overshadow the good work and constructive discussions occurring in SBSTA and ADP.""

Meanwhile, all was quiet on the SBI front. Under the ADP, parties began to reflect on the way forward. After the informal plenary, one delegate worried that there was ""little articulation of the package of decisions necessary at COP 19."" Some also voiced concern that in light of Tuesday's events, it ""may be difficult to justify sending delegates to climate meetings if no formal negotiations take place.""

Reportedly, a large number of parties feeling strongly about linkages between adaptation and mitigation urged for a technical paper on costs and benefits of adaptation based on existing science. Agreement was only reached on synthesizing submissions. Emerging from the plenary, some were nevertheless optimistic about the ADP outcome ""some time in the future,"" but many admitted that they were worried that the negotiations were not adequately focused and progressing fast enough.

Some lamented, however, that the painless adoption of the heavily loaded agenda had been marred by two hours of opening statements. As a result, no time was left for opening statements under the SBSTA in the evening. While the adoption of the agenda did not create any drama, the COP opening plenary was nonetheless highly emotional with many evoking the devastation caused by typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, Viet Nam and other countries in the region.

Multiple meetings did not seem to yield much common ground. While some seemed keen to complement the familiar Kyoto mechanisms with new ones, others pointedly asked ""why establish new mechanisms - where will the demand come from?"" Some also continued to question the fundamental need for market mechanisms, stressing the need for robust domestic mitigation measures instead. The only agreement emerging was that concrete results, especially regarding new mechanisms, will take time. Delegates continued to be moved by the plight of those affected by typhoon Haiyan. In the contact group on loss and damage, references to the damage in her country moved a Philippine delegate to tears. Throughout the day, red circles appeared on some participants' lapels to show solidarity with Naderev Saño, the Climate Change Commissioner from the Philippines, and join his voluntary fast.

In various meeting rooms, requests were made to avoid overlapping meetings under similar agenda items. Delegates were also spotted frantically making notes on draft texts at the venue's coffee shops. Some seemed concerned, as the back-to-back meetings meant less time to study text and provide comments. One rather upbeat delegate said he was impressed with how everyone is ""rolling up their sleeves"" with extra meetings scheduled in the evening to work on draft texts ""when we're not meeting on a thousand other things."" The issue of finance took center stage this time in the ADP's open-ended discussions in the morning, with points of order by several developing countries asking to focus on finance in the pre-2020 period before addressing the post-2020 period. Their interventions reflected widespread concerns that pre-2020 finance may not be forthcoming.

Some also felt that discussions on some issues were going ""in circles."" On technology discussions under the ADP, familiar controversies emerged concerning IPRs. In the SBI/SBSTA technology discussions, parties debated whether to refer to the World Trade Organization and World Intellectual Property Organization. Some also commented that progress on national adaptation plans slowed and, according to one delegate, impeded parties from focusing attention on loss and damage. One negotiator noted that the live meetings schedule briefly slotting ""Loss and Damage: 4 pm until ..."" indicated that no one could, at this stage, estimate an end time, or date, for completing negotiations on this issue. Some items, such as REDD+, broke the mold, making comparatively good progress. One delegate, however, suggested that progress on REDD+ was an attempt to ""save the day,"" as consensus on other issues was not forthcoming. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres sought to bring inspiration to the proceedings by drawing attention to photographs showcasing CDM projects during an afternoon event on the CDM Changing Lives Photo and Video Contest. She said these photos are proof that the CDM is not an ""esoteric"" exercise, and that the mechanism is a ""treasure trove"" of ideas and tools for negotiators currently working to develop new market mechanisms. However, negotiations on the various agenda items related to market mechanisms were not progressing as smoothly. Many brackets filled the texts on the framework for various approaches, and delegates also struggled to find common ground on changes to the CDM modalities and procedures.

At the International Coal and Climate Summit, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres delivered a keynote speech, warning that ""the coal industry faces a business continuation risk it can no longer afford to ignore."" Previously, an open letter signed by several NGOs requested Figueres to withdraw from the event, worried that her presence would lend credibility to a conference ""that should not be legitimized."" Responding to these concerns, and subsequently gaining a somewhat cautious approval from one NGO representative, Figueres specified in her keynote address that her presence ""is neither a tacit approval of coal use, nor is it a call for the immediate disappearance of coal.

In the ADP, the production of a draft decision text generated considerable interest.

Outside the ministerial events, many spoke of a ""blockage"" in discussions on loss and damage. This latest frustration came at the time when others expressed sentiments over other difficult issues, such as finance and the ADP work plan. One delegate expected a late night discussing loss and damage, and other intractable issues, ""possibly in conjunction"" with each other.

They noted that the style of the Peruvian Presidency bodes well for a transparent and ambitious COP. Others felt energized by the UN Climate Summit, with one delegate expressing hope that the ADP builds on the momentum generated. This optimism was short-lived, however, as the mood in the plenary soon seemed to return to a ""negotiations as usual"" mode. The one and a half hour delay to the start of the session was, according to one delegate, a sign of bad old habits kicking in at a time when ""there is little time and so much to do."" A few delegates commented that meeting the 2015 deadline seems all the more challenging, with agreement within country groups becoming more difficult, as illustrated by the lack of new submissions under workstream 1 by a number of key coalitions. Discussions at ADP 2-6 over the week will show if parties are able to seize, as one delegate put it, the ""glimmer of hope"" generated by the informal consultations in Lima and the UN Climate Summit.",600,Bonn Climate Change Conference - October 2014

As discussions on adaptation began, however, a stream of lengthy statements unfolded, and even the Co-Chairs' initiative to allow mixed seating did little to speed up the pace. While delegates recognized that a constructive dialogue did take place, some lamented that a lot of time was lost in ""repeating the obvious,"" with accumulating delays in addressing items on the ADP's busy agenda. With negotiations sliding back to familiar patterns, many remarked that it was clear that more negotiating time would be needed to meet the April 2015 deadline announced by the Co-Chairs. The contact group on ADP item 3 took the lion's share of delegates' attention, with the full-day TEM on CCUS attracting limited participation. Some delegates lamented that, while the TEM format is useful for awareness raising, it allows little time for in-depth discussions.

Others, however, wondered how far parties had in fact moved since Durban, especially as some characterized the start of INDC discussions as ""demoralizing."" Positions on INDCs were highly polarized, and while one optimistic delegate noted that ""at least they are considering text,"" another pondered whether there was any hope to see the INDCs process through. A sense of déjà vu also characterized the TEM on non-CO2 gases, where an old dilemma on whether to address the phase out of HFCs under the UNFCCC or the Montreal Protocol resurfaced, alongside more technical and action-oriented presentations, a reminder of how the UNFCCC process and action on the ground often seem to be moving on two different tracks.",602,Bonn Climate Change Conference - October 2014

One area where divergence clearly emerged was that of INDCs. Whereas most delegates agreed the world has changed since the adoption of the Convention, interpretations of what this means were situated on a long spectrum, between what some labelled as the ""one-size-fits-all"" and ""bifurcated"" approaches. At the same time, a number of parties made explicit efforts to bring the opposite sides closer to each other. A suggestion by Brazil on a ""concentric"" differentiation created a small buzz, with many interested in exploring how to operationalize it. The briefing on cooperative activities to build capacity for preparing INDCs was also welcomed by many as a useful space for sharing information. All in all, with the long, autumn shades accompanying delegates on their way to evening coordination meetings, even the festival of light, Diwali, celebrated on Thursday as noted by Co-Chair Kumarsingh, was unable to fully lighten the mood, and some were already looking forward to the Lima spring to ""illuminate their thinking.""",603,Bonn Climate Change Conference - October 2014

""The process is really allowing us to delve into parties' proposals,"" said one delegate, who added ""we can start to make real progress now we know exactly what is on the table."" Others worried that the decision to postpone discussions on mitigation until the last day of the meeting meant this important issue would be left without enough time for consideration.

The literal heat of the venue prompted one delegate to exclaim ""this is just like a greenhouse and this is exactly what's happening to our planet.""

As the ADP began negotiations on draft decision text and consideration of elements of the future agreement in parallel contact groups in the afternoon, this shift in gears was welcomed by a large number of parties.

This optimism was, however, overshadowed by a perceived lack of mutual confidence among parties. With positions and remaining points of contention clear on many issues, a sense of frustration grew in the corridors as many delegates raised concerns over the slow progress under the ADP. In the group on finance, parties that viewed the adjectives ""adequate"" and ""predictable"" as problematic were challenged to explain ""how inadequate and unpredictable finance could enhance climate action."" One seasoned delegate voiced a view shared by many: ""we know where we stand; it's high time we moved beyond the justify-your-position negotiating mode and built bridges."" In the ADP afternoon session, some parties' resistance to working with draft decision text on the screen was countered with a proposal to continue informal negotiations in Spanish.

Despite a full day of negotiations under the ADP, delegates were left with mixed feelings on progress.

Those stepping in and out of the different ADP contact group sessions could easily be led to believe the topic under discussion had not changed, with familiar and similar themes voiced by different parties and groups independent of the issue - be it mitigation, transparency or technology. This, and the approaching holiday season, prompted one observer to wonder if parties were repeating themselves ""to make sure Santa Claus hears their wish list and makes it come true."" The fact that other familiar scenes played out around the venue was not lost on participants either: ""it's the same issues holding up the Subsidiary Bodies every year,"" sighed one. Many were acutely aware of President Pulgar-Vidal's promise that the SBI would close on Friday and SBSTA on Saturday, and several delegates reported being ""dressed down"" by their contact group co-chairs for taking too much time. Any items without agreement would be ""punted,"" in one delegate's words, to the June meeting of the Subsidiary Bodies. For some, this stringency was welcomed as something that ""will hopefully create space for the ADP and COP/CMP issues,"" and as ""a much-needed wake up call to negotiators.""

Under the COP, parties remained far apart on climate finance, yet many hoped the high-level segment on climate finance, scheduled for Tuesday, would yield some traction. Some parties anticipated that discussions would take place in late night sessions, ""if the COP presidency gives the green light.""

One developing country delegate said ""our ability to come up with co-financing amounts to a barrier to accessing finance."" While delegates reacted to ""on the spot questions"" posed by the co-facilitator hoping for a ""green light"" on some of the issues under discussion, not much progress was achieved. ""I love colors, but a traffic light system doesn't work in the UNFCCC,"" one delegate warned, ""regardless of the color, the text is still bracketed."" Disagreements intensified as developing countries raised concerns over reductions in GEF funds available for climate change under the GEF's sixth replenishment. ""I am surprised,"" one developed country delegate confessed, ""since some of the decrease can be explained by the prioritization of funds for poorer countries.""

Still, some hoped that the presence of ministers could help finally bridge the ""substantial gaps"" remaining in several areas, and build badly needed ""trust and reassurances,"" under the ADP. Many delegates felt the need for greater and sustained political engagement was becoming palpable. A veteran negotiator declared a meeting to be convened by the President of the UN General Assembly on 29 June 2015 ""a great idea"" and seemed unperturbed about adding yet another meeting to the dense climate agenda for 2015. Concerns over ""overloading"" negotiators were mirrored in the ADP contact group where a procedural decision to work on the basis of ""alternative"" paragraphs instead of brackets made one delegate exclaim: ""my eyes are hurting already from keeping up with all this new text, and I am not sure we have agreed on a single paragraph yet."" As nominations for bodies under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol started to filter in, some delegates remarked that it was good to have a breath of ""fresh air.""

A debate around whether this would entail a restructuring and ""clustering"" exercise within each section, or directly addressing substance, prompted a delegate to note that sometimes gears ""unpleasantly groan"" when shifted. While discussions on how to proceed took up precious time, most welcomed them as moving onto the right track ""to overhaul the text and get in gear for negotiations.""

Some parties called for the ADP Co-Chairs to craft a consolidated text and others urged raising the number of negotiating days before Paris.

Looking to the second week when ministers arrive, many hoped that the agreed mode of work, centered around the Paris Committee, together with ministerial consultations, would serve as a strong basis for inclusive negotiation. A negotiator from a smaller delegation, however, could not help but worry that talks would move away from the Committee and end up behind closed doors for prioritized issues. A number of delegates worried over some issues receiving more attention than others. With ministerial attention now fixed on just four issues in the working groups, some delegates were concerned that issues of importance to them were being left at ""the bottom of the pile.""

The minister-led informal consultations, also referred to as indabas, occurred under the new Paris Committee, in a format reminiscent of COP 17, in Durban, where parties could openly express their views. In 2011, this procedural innovation was widely credited with facilitating the emergence of the Durban Mandate, which is to conclude here in Paris. Yet, early views were mixed on whether these French indabas would facilitate the significant work still to be completed for a new agreement. Some of the delegates still standing after a number of tireless days working on the new agreement expressed slight disappointment over Sunday's initial consultations, as one worried that ""we did not move beyond statements of positions."" However, many thought the next two days would be the real harbinger of what progress can be achieved on key issues. ""We really have the chance to achieve something extraordinary here,"" said one. Another hopeful participant pointed to possible compromises discussed in bilaterals on workstream 2 where parties had found common ground ""on many of the crunch issues."" A seasoned negotiator said she was ""cautiously optimistic"" about a strong workstream 2 outcome, ""especially if there is progress on accelerated implementation and adaptation."" In the first official meeting of the Paris Committee, ministers who facilitated discussions reported uneven progress. One delegate, emerging from the informal discussions on technology access said she was ""relieved"" that a landing zone might be emerging on the sticky issue of intellectual property rights. Another delegate said she was ""not surprised"" that discussions on differentiation had not really moved along and wondered if higher-level political guidance was needed. Meanwhile, some of last week's disappointment regarding the lack of progress on the 2013-2015 review of the long-term goal was turning into hope as word of a ""high ambition coalition"" spread among negotiators. ""1.5°C is still a possibility, we can't give up"" said an observer. Another noted ""we need more than a lowest common denominator agreement"" and hoped that ""we can finally change the mindset about ambitious action."" Yet, similarly to the indabas in Durban, the Paris informal consultations are closed to observers, with only the Paris Committee open, albeit for many via television at the venue. One forgiving civil society member understood that ""negotiation space is necessary so we will refrain from an outcry."" Others were less happy about the new arrangements. Looking ahead, many wondered how President Fabius' timeline to have an agreement ready by Wednesday for legal review could be possible.

A generally positive mood regarding the mode of work continued among negotiators, with one hoping that the French Presidency would guide countries ""through the last mile"" in a similar spirit. With ministers hidden from sight in indabas, bilateral consultations and party-led spin-offs, speculation on issues being discussed and possible deals struck was thick in the air at the open areas around Le Bourget. One of the hotly-discussed issues was potential movement toward a reference to 1.5°C as the long-term temperature goal in the Paris agreement. Despite announcements by Canada and other countries that the agreement should reference 1.5°C, some delegates quietly said that this ""seemed a long way off,"" expecting that some countries would only accept an ""under 2°C"" goal. The issue was more positively framed in the report backs of the Comité de Paris, with the facilitator of the consultations on ambition saying ""most"" support reference to 1.5°C. Others worried that the focus on quantitative goals risked overshadowing other, important qualitative guiding lights such as decarbonization, net-zero, indigenous peoples' rights, human rights and gender equality. The report back at the Comité de Paris in the evening did not surprise some observers by including qualitative terms such as food security that referred back to Convention Article 2 (objective). Civil society too demonstrated for ""surviving and thriving at 1.5°C,"" while an observer wondered whether the world could ""celebrate an agreement simply because it includes reference to 1.5°C,"" without asking whether it contains the mechanisms to review and ratchet up ambition to realize those goals. Those not in the closed rooms listened with an attentive ear to the BASIC press conference, looking for hints on the state of negotiations from ministers from Brazil, South Africa, India and China. Some delegates paid attention to references made to language on finance and transparency in the US-China Joint Presidential Statement on Climate Change from September 2015, with one noting ""a déjà vu from Lima"" where language on differentiation was taken near-verbatim from a US-China joint announcement. Finance, an issue many see as crucial for any agreement in Paris, seemed to occupy much of the time in the informal ministerial consultations on MOI. That group, according to the report from the co-facilitators, also yielded significant progress on capacity building, which one delegate credited to a positive spirit in the room, with interested parties huddling over text. With the days remaining to reach an agreement dwindling fast, many delegates walking out of the evening meeting of the Comité de Paris were pleased that a ""clean"" text would be produced by the minister facilitators, the Presidency and the ADP co-facilitators for Wednesday afternoon. Despite quietly shared fears of some parties over the work still remaining ahead, and potential ""surprises"" and reports of ""fault lines"" on differentiation by facilitators, all parties continued to praise the transparency and positive spirit in the Comité de Paris.

Immediately after receiving their copies, delegates poured over the text. As some optimists had expected, the positive spirit prevailed throughout the afternoon Comité de Paris meeting, surprising some observers accustomed to drama as a regular feature of climate COPs. Most delegates remained in full praise of the Presidency, commending their work with the facilitators and Secretariat to finish the text lasting into the wee hours of Wednesday morning. One negotiator explained the positive mood was a result of the Presidency ""involving the ministers early and often in the process, which built relationships and facilitated constructive conversations on sticking points."" Pointing out that the three remaining political issues, differentiation, finance and ambition, are more than ""small details,"" one long-time observer noted that ""some brackets are more stubborn than others."" Others' eyes initially spotted phrases that raised eyebrows, either negatively or positively depending on their perspective, like per capita emissions and respect for indigenous peoples' rights. Still, some close to the ministerial process seemed confident, saying that the ""agreement should be quite agreeable"" to parties if they manage to ""zoom out to see the bigger picture."" Speculating on the evening, one delegate hoped the good mood would not be ephemeral, calling Wednesday evening the ""defining moment"" of the second week. To witness that defining moment, delegates again flowed into La Seine in the evening. Many offered cautious optimism, with one saying that ""all the elements are here, and relatively well balanced."" Another cited the ""quite clean"" text on workstream 2. The first round of applause was for the G-77/China's statement that the text formed an acceptable basis for negotiations. While there seemed to be a never-ending stream of groups' and parties' concerns with the text, their overwhelming general acceptance of the text as the basis for further work represented to some a collective sigh of relief. However, one delegate cautioned against assuming that if ""everyone expresses concerns, that the text is indeed balanced."" Some also worried parties were regressing to stated positions. Leaving La Seine for the two midnight sessions announced by COP 21 President Fabius, many looked ahead to some political deals occurring in the coming hours. As they entered into the midnight consultations, one group of delegates hoped Friday would be a day of rest, while the legal and linguistic group reviews the text. However, with COP 21 President Fabius describing the next iteration of the text, expected for Thursday afternoon, as the ""penultimate text,"" many delegates wondered if their hopes of Paris being an exceptional COP in terms of timeliness could still materialize.",661,2015 Paris Climate Change Conference
COP 21 - CMP 11,http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12662e.html,29 November - 13 December 2015,"Paris, France",10 December 2015,"Thursday morning dawned with reports that the previous night's indaba and informal consultations had lasted until dawn. The few exhausted high-level delegates that were to be found in the hallways of Le Bourget gave mixed reports on progress in the informals. Some seemed rather pessimistic, perhaps magnified by the lack of sleep, reporting on ""very limited movement"" on the key political issues and saying that parties had spent much of their time reading statements reiterating long-held positions. Another said that, perhaps, ""just enough flexibility"" had been shown to enable compromises to start materializing. Those in the venue remained in limbo throughout the day, waiting impatiently for the ""penultimate"" draft text, as foreseen by COP 21 President Laurent Fabius on Wednesday evening. Others clustered informally to continue hashing out language to bridge various parties' proposals, in preparation for the final push towards an agreement expected by some as early as Thursday night. The wait was longer than anticipated, with Thursday's Comité meeting being postponed twice, first from 3:00pm to 7:00pm, and then finally to 9:00pm. Throughout the day, delegates continued stressing that differentiation, finance and ambition remained the outstanding issues, a fact confirmed in the evening meetings of the Comité, where COP 21 President Laurent Fabius observed that these issues remained bracketed in the new text. With the finish line in sight, the COP Presidency and the Secretariat seemed to be aiming to leave as little as possible to chance. Several delegates reported ""unprecedented"" personal attention by the French Presidency to engage parties' raising concerns in plenary and ensure their issues were addressed. One reported that the very highest levels were throwing all of their effort into smoothing the path towards agreement, with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon engaging in bilaterals with parties on key issues. As was to be expected, ministerial engagement ramped up as well, with a number of countries holding their own bilaterals. Around the venue's cafeterias, several delegations expressed concern over the rapid pace of negotiations and the large number of bilaterals and consultations, saying these were overwhelming for small delegations while also noting that precious negotiation time was quickly ticking away. One committed, but exhausted, delegate quipped during the COP plenary, ""I won't use the word disorganized, but we now find ourselves in a dynamic process that makes attending to all remaining issues difficult."" Nevertheless, as the meeting turned nocturnal, after a long day of waiting and with a long night of negotiation ahead, another delegate reminded the weary, ""there is just too much at stake to fail.""",662,2015 Paris Climate Change Conference
SB 44,http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12667e.html,16-26 May 2016,"Bonn, Germany",17 May 2016,"After a well-deserved break from negotiations, refreshed delegates arrived at the World Conference Center Bonn. Many parties indicated readiness to start ""putting some flesh onto the bones of the Paris Agreement."" Indeed, the words ""unity"" and ""momentum"" seemed omnipresent, with one participant pointing to the strong message sent by the 177 parties that have already signed the Paris Agreement. While one delegate warned of the dangers of becoming ""dizzy with euphoria,"" some concerns rose that the SBI agenda item on the registry of NDCs mandated by the Paris outcome did not adequately reflect adaptation. Others expressed concern with the proposed APA agenda, but seemed hopeful that consultations would pave the way for a smooth start to its substantive work. Most countries indeed seemed to be determined to ""ride the wave"" of goodwill generated by Paris.",667,Bonn Climate Change Conference - May 2016

The plenary started with a rapid election of the body's first Co-Chairs, which proved particularly amicable as delegates congratulated themselves for electing two women. Despite this, some worried that parties were falling back into old habits and entrenched political discussions with disagreement on the details of the agenda. A delegate noted the parallel between the previous day's disagreement on the SBI agenda, and the current deadlock over the APA agenda, which he said both reflect the concerns of some parties to treat adaptation on an equal footing with mitigation. Some delegates hoped that the new Co-Chairs would be able to rise to this early challenge and solve the agenda issues, especially given the solidarity expressed during the plenary.",668,Bonn Climate Change Conference - May 2016

One delegate found it was difficult at times to ""find a safe space to negotiate,"" as the lack of clarity on the agendas infringed upon discussions in other areas, with delegates trying to sort through ""old work"" from the Convention and the Protocol, and ""new work"" emanating from the Paris outcome. While eager to start this new work in earnest, many recognized the importance of getting the agenda right and balancing the weight of its components. As informal consultations continue, one delegate worried, ""although agenda controversies were expected, they now delay discussions on important agenda items."" With the APA Co-Chairs inviting written submissions on amendments to the agenda, an observer hoped that Thursday would bring greater clarity and what one observer called a ""real start"" to the APA.",669,Bonn Climate Change Conference - May 2016

To the casual observer, the continuing consultations on the APA and SBI agendas might almost have gone unnoticed. Mulling over the APA Co-Chairs' ""snapshot"" of the draft agenda based on discussions with groups and parties, several delegates thought the options for compromises offered in this draft had moved delegates closer, including on how to take stock of the work in the subsidiary and constituted bodies to advance the Agreement. As SBSTA and SBI already undertake some of this work, one participant took comfort in the APA's delay, saying that it allowed for the two permanent subsidiary bodies to ""pick up speed after staying in the margins"" during much of 2015.",670,Bonn Climate Change Conference - May 2016

A delegate coming out of the first workshop for the facilitative sharing of views under the international consultation and analysis process said the presentations by the first batch of non-Annex I countries, and the question-and-answer sessions that followed, ""showed goodwill and a spirit of confidence that will be useful going forward."" Confidence also built in the APA, where a sigh of relief was almost audible when its agenda was adopted after several days of informal consultations. A seasoned delegate pleased with the outcome stated that time had ""not really been wasted"" as the agenda may stay with us ""for a while."" The joy of those eager to see substantive negotiations start under the APA, however, seemed shortlived, with the announcement that consultations would resume, this time on the organization of work. Still, many noted that general convergence on how to carry work forward was observable in the APA plenary, which they felt bodes well for swift progress.",671,Bonn Climate Change Conference - May 2016

One delegate was relieved that the APA had not slipped into ""ADP mode,"" given the steady progress on the organization of work. Meanwhile, in the public registry discussions under the SBI, parties seemed to enter a ""jungle"" as a metaphor on animals and forests inspired delegates to argue whether the ""animals"" of mitigation and adaptation should live in the same ""forest"" of the registry, some asking if the two ""species"" could coexist. As delegates left the stocktaking hosted jointly by the COP 21 and 22 Presidencies, a few acknowledged that, so far, SB 44 helped retain the ""sense of solidarity that parties carried from Lima and Paris.""",672,Bonn Climate Change Conference - May 2016

One delegate worried that the APA contact group saw some ""post-Paris positioning,"" concerned that ""it may take time for negotiators to move to technical mode."" Others welcomed the progress achieved so far, noting some ""ups and downs"" are to be expected. Another seasoned observer hoped that co-facilitators would be named for the various APA items by the end of the session as a signal that parties would be ready to ""get down to work"" in Marrakesh.

Tensions persisted: one delegate expressed frustrations that some parties were ""cherry picking"" which aspects of the Paris Agreement to dig into, while another said old positions still loomed, slowing technical work. With well-known entrenched positions re-emerging, including on the science-policy interface, one delegate worried that if progress did not accelerate at SB 44, ""one year will have passed without work since Paris"" when parties come together again in Marrakech. Others disagreed, recognizing that calls emerging from the informal consultations for technical papers, workshops, submissions, dialogues and stakeholder actions signaled for important work to be expected in preparation for and during COP 22. Late in the day, observers welcomed a special event by the French and Moroccan Presidencies on the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage, grateful that ""loss and damage had not completely disappeared from this session."" With an abundance of examples from NGOs and IGOs on how they are supporting resilience, insurance, risk management, gender responsiveness and much more, participants left the room feeling upbeat about the range of solutions being advanced by non-state actors.

Yet, some delegates felt there was still a lack of clarity on whether COP 22 would be an ""action,"" ""implementation,"" ""MOI"" or perhaps a ""youth"" COP. As delegates gathered to coordinate on the draft conclusions circulated by the APA Co-Chairs that provide a roadmap for Marrakech, what was clear was that they would leave Bonn with what one delegate called a ""laundry list"" of submissions that would keep them busy over the summer.",675,Bonn Climate Change Conference - May 2016

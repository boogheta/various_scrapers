Furthermore, it noted the increased usefulness of the terrestrial ECVs beyond observations of climate change, such as for biodiversity and desertification, and it encouraged the GTOS to increase synergy with ongoing relevant initiatives. Also at its thirty-third session, the SBSTA invited the GTOS to report to the SBSTA, at its thirty-fifth session, on progress made on the matters referred to in paragraph 1 above. At SBSTA 35, the secretariat of the GTOS provided a summary of progress (FCCC/SBSTA/2011.MISC.14), indicating that the report it had been invited to prepare by the SBSTA at its thirty-third session for the thirty-fifth session of the SBSTA, would be submitted to the SBSTA at its thirty-sixth session. The SBSTA agreed to consider this information at its thirty-sixth session in conjunction with any updates received from the GTOS on this matter. At SBSTA 36, however, the report by the GTOS was not available. In response to the invitation referred to in paragraph 2 above, the secretariat of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) has submitted a report on progress on 19 October 2012 on behalf of the GTOS.

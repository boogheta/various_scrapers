The five workshops were held in: Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, from 19 to 23 October 2009, Bamako, Mali, from 8 to 12 February 2010, Vientiane, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, from 4 to 8 May 2010, Sao Tome, Sao Tome and Principe, from 4 to 8 September 2010, and Apia, Samoa, from 3 to 6 November 2010. They focused on providing participants with hands-on training in the design and preparation of proposals for the implementation of adaptation projects identified in NAPAs, and in the subsequent submission of these proposals to the GEF to receive support under the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF). In addition, the workshops addressed barriers and challenges faced by least developed country Parties in accessing funding under the LDCF. Countries were grouped for the workshops according to their language and regional similarities, in order to provide a platform for learning and sharing experience and to exploit synergies. This report includes a summary of the key topics presented at each of the training workshops, as well as a summary of the issues raised by participants that need to be addressed by the GEF, its agencies and the LEG in order to further facilitate access to funds under the LDCF for the successful implementation of NAPAs|Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), Thirty-third session, 30 November - 4 December 2010, Cancun, Mexico|national adaptation programmes of action (NAPA)|Kyoto Protocol|financial mechanism;implementation;LDC Fund;least developed countries;LEG;national adaptation programmes;regional workshop;UNFCCC||2010-11-23|2010

Key findings from the paper include: the benefits of adopting multiple methods and approaches, including non-monetary ones, in accordance with the objectives of the assessment and the types of adaptation options to be assessed, the need for further methodology development, including in relation to the treatment of uncertainty, economic valuation and equity, and the continued lack of detailed analyses of the costs and benefits of adaptation, including in a form that is relevant to decisions on public funding. Parties may use the information contained in this technical paper as they consider implementing adaptation action under the Convention, including in the work under the Nairobi work programme, and particularly on its work area on socio-economic information.

It therefore invited the GCOS secretariat to prepare, under the guidance of the GCOS Steering Committee, an update of the GCOS implementation plan before its thirty-third session, including a breakdown of costs involved (FCCC/SBSTA/2009/3, paras. 5758). At the same session, the SBSTA also invited the GCOS secretariat to provide a provisional updated implementation plan in conjunction with a provisional estimation of costs, before COP 15, and requested the secretariat to make this information available as a miscellaneous document (FCCC/SBSTA/2009/3, para. 58).

Technical paper.|UNFCCC. Secretariat|http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2008/tp/09.pdf|EN|This technical paper provides information on the financial mechanisms used to manage risks from the direct impacts of climate change. The mechanisms described include both insurance mechanisms and other forms of risk spreading and sharing, referred to as non-insurance mechanisms. Developing countries require a portfolio of mechanisms, which may include insurance, to manage risks, as no one mechanism can meet the range of circumstances required by all countries. The paper considers hazards, assets and vulnerability in the context of climate change, and reviews several options for managing financial risks from impacts of climate change in developing countries. It also proposes three innovative financing schemes for this purpose. The role of external support in helping developing countries finance appropriate risk-sharing mechanisms is part of this consideration. Parties may use the information contained in this technical paper as they consider implementing adaptation action under the Convention, particularly in the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention on enhanced action on adaptation, including the in-session workshop on risk management and risk reduction strategies. The information could also be considered by Parties and organizations in their actions to manage financial risks from the direct impacts of climate change and to enhance resilience to the impacts of the adverse effects of climate change|Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), Twenty-ninth session, 1-10 December 2008, Poznan, Poland|technical papers|assessment of impacts, vulnerability and adaptation|adverse effects of climate change;climate impacts;developing countries;financial mechanism;financing;risk;risk management;UNFCCC||2008-11-21|2008

Secretariat|http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2006/tp/tp01.pdf|EN|This technical paper provides an overview of issues relating to the topic of innovative financing for technology transfer related to climate change. It also includes an analysis of progress in the area of innovative financing, both in the public and private sectors, and a synthesis of successes and failures. The paper argues that creating innovative options for financing the transfer of environmentally sound technologies implies finding new ways to ‘connect’ actors and interests, and not just designing or developing new financing products. An important aspect of this crossover between the financing community and the climate change community is the attention given to elements of financial viability which are at the core of many climate change projects. This paper elaborates on these developments and explores options, with cases and examples from mitigation and adaptation practice.|Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), Twenty-fourth session, 18-26 May 2006, Bonn, Germany|technical papers|technology transfer|adaptation to climate change;capacity building;environmentally sound technology;financing;mitigation;technology needs assessments;technology transfer||2006-08-28|2006

Subsequently, in decision 7/CP.2, the COP requested the secretariat to enhance its progress reports with information from the national communications from Parties included in Annex II to the Convention, due in April 1997. The COP, at it second session, also asked the secretariat to make suggestions with regard to further improvements in the format for reporting information on the transfer of existing environmentally sound technologies and know-how from Annex II Parties. At its second session, the COP also requested the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) to evaluate and report on the transfer of technologies being undertaken between Annex II Parties and other Parties, and to do so by drawing on a roster of experts (decision 7/CP.2). In response to the above mentioned requests, this note provides a compilation and synthesis of actions taken by reporting Annex II Parties with respect to finance and transfer of technology, and describes how the reporting guidelines in this area were followed in the preparation of national communications. As a result of the data limitation described below, the secretariat has deferred compilation of comprehensive financial tables to a subsequent report.
